As a matter of fact, I\\nrecommend you skip through the book reading all the stories first. They will\\ninspire you to read all the way through and actually do the Proven Plan to\\nFinancial Fitness.\\n \\nMany years ago I was given a calling: to show people the truth about debt\\nand money and to give them the hope and tools necessary to set themselves\\nfree financially. First, I did that with a few speaking engagements and a small\\nself-published book titled Financial \\nPeace. Later Financial \\nPeace was\\npublished by a New York publisher and became our first New York Times\\nbestseller. I began doing a small local radio show that has now grown to more\\nthan 450 stations and millions of listeners that tune in weekly. We started\\nteaching a thirteen-week class called Financial Peace University, which has\\nhad over 1 million families attend. Then came The Total Money Makeover.\\nI am positive that personal finance is 80 percent behavior and only 20\\npercent head knowledge. Our concentration on behavior—realizing that most\\nfolks have a good idea of what to do with money but not how to do it—has\\nled us to a different view of personal finance. Most financial people make the\\nmistake of trying to show you the numbers, thinking that you just don’t get\\nthe math. I am sure that the problem with my money is the guy in my mirror.\\nIf he will behave, he can make the money thing work. The math of wealth\\nbuilding is not rocket science; it is simple—but you have to DO IT!\\nSo the proven Total Money Makeover plan I teach has become very\\nsuccessful not because I have found the secrets of the rich. Not because I had\\nsome revelation that no one else has ever had about credit cards. Not because I\\nam the only one with a “ Debt Snowball” plan. Instead, this proven plan is\\nhaving a national impact because I have realized that to change your money\\nthing, you have to change. You have to change your life. When you change\\nyour life, you will get out of debt, give, and invest at an unbelievable rate.\\nWhen you read the stories in this book, you will read not about mathematics,\\n\\nor magic systems, but about changed lives. You will read about transformed\\nmarriages and relationships. Because when you change your life, you really\\nchange your life.\\nSo when Mike Hyatt, the president and CEO of Thomas Nelson\\nPublishers, brought me the concept for a Total Money Makeover book, I\\nbecame very excited. I became excited because I knew this book would inspire\\nreaders to take immediate action through a simple, step-by-step process that\\ncould only lead to life-changing results. Hope—the light at the end of the\\ntunnel, that is, not an oncoming train—is a very powerful force. The Total\\nMoney Makeover has given HOPE to hundreds of thousands of families. This\\nbook has given them hope to win, and that hope has caused them to take\\naction and claim ultimate victory over their financial struggles and worries—\\nand to actually win! The number of people that I meet across this nation who\\ntell me this is the first book of any kind they have read in ten years is\\nstaggering. The Total Money Makeover is a book for everyone. It is for high-\\nincome earners, as I am. And it is for someone beginning at the bottom,\\nwhich is where I once was.\\nYou are about to read about a process, a proven plan, to win. You will find\\nthe plan to be very simple yet very inspiring. The principles are not mine. I\\nstole them all from God and your grandmother. The principles are common\\nsense, which isn’t so common anymore. The plan is mine—and I’m no\\ngenius—created by simply observing literally millions of lives with whom I\\nhave interacted through radio, TV, books, classes, the Internet, e-mail,\\npodcasts, and our Live Events. I have successfully bottled common sense\\nabout money into a plan that anyone can do. And millions are!\\nA couple of decades ago, when I first started talking about these principles,\\nI knew they had helped my wife, Sharon, and me survive going broke and\\nbegin to prosper. The first hundred times I spoke on money, I wasn’t as\\nconfident of the principles as I am now. Nowadays I look into the eyes of a\\ngazillion people who have followed this plan and experienced, as we did,\\nexcitement, hope, and gratitude. I am so thankful that I have not only given\\nthem a proven plan but have also inspired them to change their family tree.\\n\\nI am so confident in The Total Money Makeover principles and this process\\nthat I cannot stand it when someone doesn’t get it. Because I am so\\nconvinced my plan will work for everyone, my answers to the same questions\\nwill never change. By recognizing and identifying some basic truths and\\neveryday common sense, I have convinced millions of people to change their\\nlives—to have a Total Money Makeover. Are you next?\\n\\nRead this\\nBEFORE You Buy\\nThe Book!\\n \\nWhat This Book Is NOT\\n \\nI know it may be hard for you to believe, but I get a lot of hate mail and\\ncriticism. This book and what I have or have not said in it has generated a lot\\nof negativity and name-calling. That is fun. Not fun because I set out to offend\\nor because I love reading the nasty things people often say. It is fun because\\nthe negativity means two things: One, for some people we are touching a\\nnerve that needs to be touched in order for them to change their lives, and\\ntwo, I am actively and passionately pursuing the truth. (Aristotle once said\\n“ To avoid criticism say nothing, do nothing, and be nothing.”) I can’t help\\nmillions of people change their lives by saying nothing, doing nothing, and\\nbeing nothing. So I take the anger, the criticism, and even the hate mail as\\nencouragement.\\n \\nMy publisher suggested I “ answer my critics.” I will pass. My\\ngrandmother used to say, “ Those convinced against their will are of the same\\nopinion still.” However, I do not want you, dear reader, to be misled. So it is\\nappropriate that I tell you what this book is NOT. That way you can decide\\nwhether or not to spend your hard-earned money on it.\\nThis Book Is NOT Sophisticated or Complicated\\n \\nIf you are looking for a detailed, in-depth guide to investing, you have not\\nfound it. If you are looking for boring academic chirping that will put you to\\nsleep using words only to support the author’s ego, you have not found it.\\nWhat I have discovered is that some of the most profound and life-changing\\ntruths you will ever discover are very simple.\\n \\n\\nIn our culture we worship the complicated and the sophisticated. If you\\nknow how to work your DVD player, you may not have a good one. In the\\nfinancial world we have been taught to be arrogant snobs. Some believe that\\nsimple ideas are not profound, that instead, simple ideas are for the “ little\\npeople.” That is a false and arrogant notion. I have met with thousands of\\nmillionaires, and in almost every case they keep their investing and money\\nphilosophies very uncomplicated. Just this week I was discussing investing\\nand business structure with a friend of mine whose net worth is over twenty\\nmillion dollars, and his words to me were, “ I always keep it simple and\\nclean.” Only the financial goobers like to complicate things for the sake of\\njustifying their existence or justifying how much they paid for their education.\\nPlease do not look here for a detailed guide to set up an estate plan or a deep\\ntheory on investing. That is not what I do. What I do is help people\\nunderstand and act on time-honored truths about money that will truly change\\nyour whole life.\\nThis Book Is NOT Something That Has Never Been Said\\nThere are many great money authors out there today, and there are even more\\nin our past. Very little that you read in this book will be something that\\nsomeone else has not written or said. We often say on our radio show that we\\ngive the same financial advice your grandmother would, only we keep our\\nteeth in. I suggest you read a lot of different people, as I do. I have invented\\nvery little in this area of money. What I have done is packaged the time-\\nhonored information into a process that is doable and has inspired millions of\\npeople to act on it. Most of us know what to do; we just have trouble doing\\nit. How do you lose weight? Exercise more and eat less. I know that, and yet\\nI bought and read a couple of books on the subject while I took action, and I\\nlost thirty pounds. Did the authors of those books tell me big ideas that were\\ngroundbreaking? No, they simply gave me an action plan and some\\nsupporting details to what I already knew had to be done. Welcome to my\\nworld.\\n\\nThis Book Is NOT Going to Mislead You on Investment\\nReturns\\nThere are several ignorant people in our country today on the returns offered\\nby investing well. Ignorance is not lack of intelligence; it is simply “ not\\nknowing.” Sadly, many intelligent but ignorant people seem to think that\\nmaking a 12 percent rate of return on your money in a long-term investment is\\nimpossible. And that if I state that there is a 12 percent rate of return available,\\nthen I have lied to you or misled you.\\nI recommend good growth stock-type mutual funds in this book as a long-\\nterm investment and dare to state that you should make 12 percent on your\\nmoney over time. The supporting data for that bold statement can be found by\\nlooking at the historical averages of the S&P 500 index. Widely regarded as\\nthe best single gauge of the US equities market, the Standard & Poor’s 500 is\\nan index with 500 of the largest companies in leading industries of the US\\neconomy. The S&P 500 has averaged 11.67 percent per year for the last\\neighty plus years, as of this writing. This includes the big drop in the 2008\\nmarket. Most experts and anyone who has had even one finance class agree\\nthat the S&P 500 is a great statistical measure of stock market returns. This is\\nsuch a standard, or bellwether, that virtually every stock fund will show you\\nits returns in comparison to the S&P 500.\\nI purchased a Growth and Income Stock Mutual Fund many years ago, that\\nI still invest in, and it has averaged 12.03 percent per year since 1934 (75\\nyears as of this writing). I bought another last week that has averaged over\\n13.9 percent per year since 1973, as of this writing. And yet another with\\naverage annual returns of 12.01 percent since 1984, and another averaging\\n12.39 percent since 1973, and yet another averaging 11.72 percent since 1952.\\nAny decent broker with the heart of a teacher can, in his or her sleep, lead you\\nto funds with long track records averaging over 12 percent. So don’t let\\nanyone tell you that you can’t predict a 12 percent rate when you are\\nconsidering investments for ten years or longer.\\n\\nThis Book Is NOT Written by Someone\\nwith No Academic Credentials\\nI seldom list my formal academic credentials because, honestly, I don’t think\\nthey are important. I have met so many broke people with financial credentials\\nthat I almost think it discredits me to have had formal training. Yes, I have a\\ndegree in finance. Yes, I have been or am licensed in real estate, insurance, and\\ninvestments. Yes, I do have many of the stupid letters to put after my name.\\nBut the thing that qualifies me most to teach about money is that I have done\\nstupid with zeros on the end. I have been there, done that. I have a PhD in D-\\nU-M-B. So I know what it is like to be scared and scarred. I know what it is\\nlike to have my marriage hanging by a thread because of financial stress. I\\nknow what it is like to have my hopes and dreams crushed by my own stupid\\ndecisions. That qualifies me uniquely to teach and to love hurting people.\\nThe other huge qualifier is that I used the principles I teach to personally\\nbuild wealth. My wife and I have truly lived this book. The things we teach\\nare not theory—they work!\\nBut the teaching credential that I am most sure of and which further\\nqualifies me is the hundreds of thousands of stories of people across America\\nbeing set free by this book. This stuff simply works. So don’t take financial\\nadvice from broke people.\\nThis Book Is NOT Politically Correct\\nI stated earlier that personal finance is 80 percent behavior. To properly view\\nbehavior and to understand how to change behavior intelligently, we must\\nconsider several things. Behavior intelligently viewed takes into account the\\nemotional, the relational, the family history, the socioeconomic impacts, and\\nthe spiritual. To ignore any of these while discussing behavior change about\\nmoney is incomplete and very naive. So I openly discuss the spiritual in this\\nbook. As a Christian, I include some Bible verses. This is not a “ Christian”\\nbook, and it for sure isn’t a Bible study on the subject of money. But this is a\\n\\nbook about a “ Proven Plan to Financial Fitness” that my team and I have\\ndeveloped over two decades, and that plan includes addressing the spiritual\\nissues surrounding money. So I upset both sides—those who don’t like it\\nbecause I include spiritual thoughts in my teachings and those who don’t\\nbelieve my writing is spiritual enough. Either way, you have been warned.\\nThis Book Is NOT Wrong\\nDon’t confuse extreme confidence with arrogance. I am extremely confident\\nthat this material works, because millions of people have benefited from it. I\\nam not arrogant because I realize I am not personally responsible for any of the\\nlives changed. The stuff I teach is the truth, and those principles are\\nresponsible for changing lives. But I always answer the same questions with\\nthe same answers even though sometimes folks think their situation may be\\ndifferent. It isn’t different. The principles stand, and they work every time.\\nThis Book Is NOT the Same As My Other Books\\nWhen we took on The Total Money Makeover project, we had to answer a\\nquestion of integrity: Could we honestly go into the market and ask my\\nreaders to buy another book that said the same thing? I couldn’t in good\\nconscience do that. Financial Peace has sold nearly 2 million copies as of this\\nwriting, so did I really need to write another book? I came to the conclusion\\nthat there was a distinct difference in the two projects. Financial Peace is\\n“ what to do with money.” It is a great textbook for commonsense money\\nmanagement. So how is The Total Money Makeover different? It is more than\\na “ what to do” book—it is a “ how to do it” plan. This is a process book.\\nWe are aiming at carefully weaving inspiration and information together into a\\nstep-by-step plan. Yes, you will find in this book a lot of the same subjects\\nalong with many of the same principles I discuss in my other books, but this\\nbook is different in that it is a process-driven work.\\n\\nIf you are looking for a ton of new information because you are someone\\nwho only gathers facts and figures, then you will be disappointed. If you are\\nlooking to engage this money thing head on, you will love this book. Many\\nFinancial Peace readers have told me that The Total Money Makeover gave\\nlegs to the concepts to which they had been introduced, so they were thankful\\nto read it as well. But again, don’t look for some big revelation or chapters of\\nnew principles.\\nThis Book Is NOT Getting Any Complaints or Criticism .\\n. .\\n. . . from people who do it. I have never had someone write me saying, “ I got\\non a budget, got out of debt, got on the same page with my spouse, built\\nwealth—and I HATE IT.” For those who have followed this plan and\\ndiscovered a new life of financial freedom, their lives have been changed\\nforever! Wouldn’t you like to experience the same transformation? You can\\nbe the next success story people hear about. You can have a Total Money\\nMakeover starting today!\\n\\nFlying Turkeys and Skinny Dipping\\n \\nWhen I was a child, my grandmother—a second-grade schoolteacher who also\\ntaught drama—used to sit me on her knee and read to me. She read with great\\nenthusiasm and a lot of drama.\\n \\nOne of the children’s stories she read to me was about the three little pigs.\\nOne built his house out of straw, one out of twigs, and one out of brick. You\\nknow the story—the two who built their houses “ quick and dirty” goofed off,\\npartied, and made fun of the bricklayer because he was taking too much time\\nand effort to do it right. Of course, when the wind and rains came, the two\\nshort-term thinkers ended up moving in with their brother. Why? Because he\\nhad prepared well enough to weather the storms. The other two found their\\nlives completely blown apart.\\nEconomic Storms, Real Ones\\n \\nA huge economic storm hit America—and the rest of the world—in 2008. As\\nwith all strong storms, the only houses that survived were the ones that were\\nbuilt well, on a solid foundation. The rest were blown over. Companies who\\nhad been built well survived; those who hadn’t are now history. Many once-\\ngreat businesses abandoned their strong foundations by investing in bad, high-\\nrisk investments and taking on mountains of debt. Sadly, most of those\\ncompanies are now history or are owned by someone else.\\n \\nWhat happened? Well, this is not a textbook on economics, so we won’t\\ndissect every detail. However, it is instructive to your Total Money Makeover\\nto look at the event to learn our private lessons. The 30,000-foot view that\\nyou would get from an airplane might look like this:\\nBroke people in serious financial trouble borrowed money from greedy\\nbankers at horrible terms and high interest rates to buy homes. The loans were\\nnot prime (good) loans, so they were accurately called SUBprime loans. That\\n\\njust means these mortgages were less than good. Duh.\\nThis rip-off lending has always been done, but never on such a large scale.\\nIn an effort to make more profits to keep their stock prices up, banks and\\ninvestment bankers began to buy these loans in bulk—and they bought lots of\\nthem. What was unthinkable in the investment community just a few years\\nearlier became common practice.\\nFormerly legitimate, upstanding, major banks and investment bankers\\nessentially became loan sharks using very sophisticated financial instruments.\\nFor years, the mortgage industry had packaged good mortgages together and\\nsold them as bonds. You have probably heard of Fannie Mae Bonds. That\\nused to refer to a group of good Fannie Mae mortgages that were wrapped\\ntogether and sold as unit, or bond. During this period of stupidity, however,\\nthe SUBprime (bad) loans were packaged together and sold as bonds—a lot of\\nthem.\\nWe live in a cause-and-effect world. What you sow, you will reap. In a\\nshocking turn of events, the broke people didn’t pay their mortgage payments\\n(he says sarcastically). This, for some unknown reason, seemed to surprise the\\ngreedy bankers. Surprise! Broke people can’t pay ridiculous house payments!\\nGo figure.\\nThe big problem, however, was scale. A lot of broke people didn’t pay\\ntheir payments. So, foreclosure numbers began to rise rapidly. In some boom\\nmarkets, where the real estate prices had shot up artificially high, the\\nforeclosures began bringing home prices down. And down and down.\\nWith values dropping so low, relatively secure and responsible home-\\nowners started to get in trouble too. Fear broke out on Wall Street, and stock\\nprices started dropping. By the time the fear got to Washington, it had\\nbecome a full-blown panic. And once the panic got to the news media, it had\\nbecome all-out hysteria.\\nEvery day, American consumers watched the hysteria play out on\\ntelevision. With their 401(k) and home values dropping, they wisely decided\\n\\nthis was not a good time to keep spending like a drunken Congressman.\\nWhen we stopped buying stuff at a breakneck speed, the economy slowed,\\nand businesses began hurting everywhere. Companies who were deeply in\\ndebt and cash-poor began to die. A LOT of businesses vanished almost\\novernight. People stopped buying washers and dryers, so the washer-and-dryer\\nmanufacturer started laying people off, and unemployment rose. This, of\\ncourse, just made the cycle go around again, forcing real estate and stock\\nprices even lower.\\nGood News, Bad News\\nThe good news is that we are recovering and will continue to recover. Some\\nlearned the painful lessons on a private, individual level; others learned the\\neconomic lessons on a more widespread, national level. Many people didn’t\\nlearn anything at all.\\nThe great news is that, for some of you, this event was your Great\\nDepression, emotionally speaking. The Great Depression permanently\\nchanged the way many people handled their money. If you have a grandfather\\nor great-aunt who was an adult during that time, he or she likely has a\\ncompletely different way of looking at debt, saving, and giving than most\\npeople of other generations. That is because your loved one has experience.\\nAnd as my pastor says, “ a man with an experience is not at the mercy of a\\nman with an opinion.”\\nI went broke twenty years ago, and that experience changed my life. I have\\napplied the principles of this book to my life for the past two decades, so\\nwhen this storm hit in 2008, I was just a spectator. It didn’t hurt me a bit. I\\nhave actually come out ahead by buying real estate at great prices and\\ninvesting heavily in the stock market while both were down.\\nI’ve spent the last twenty years trying to get people to live these Total\\nMoney Makeover principles. A lot of people have listened, so when the winds\\n\\nblew and the storms came, they were just as ready as I was. They had a strong\\nfoundation.\\nFlying Turkeys\\nWhat does all this mean for your Total Money Makeover? The first lesson of\\nthis economic storm is that your financial process and principles must work in\\ngood times and in bad times—otherwise, they don’t work. Our economy had\\nbeen so good for so long that really stupid ideas had been working on the\\nshort term. That fooled people into believing that stupid had become smart.\\nIn other words, stupid hadn’t been stress tested in quite a while; when it\\nfinally was, it came up looking, well, stupid.\\nWhen times are booming, you can do dumb things with money, get\\nsloppy, and take huge risks without realizing it. I have heard it said this way:\\n“ Even a turkey can fly in a tornado.” People were running around, buying\\nthings they couldn’t afford with money they didn’t have, to impress people\\nthey didn’t even like; and they were doing it in record numbers. Worse, they\\nseemed to get away with it!\\nThey were like the two little pigs with straw and twig homes: As long as\\nthe sun was shining, life was a party, and the pig with brick seemed kind of\\nnerdy, or overly conservative, or even fanatical. But when their stupid theories\\nwere stress tested, their houses fell.\\nJim Collins, one of America’s greatest business writers, has a book out\\ncalled How the Mighty Fall. In this book, he discusses the five stages of\\ndecline when a business fails, or falls. There is a great application here for our\\nnation’s economy and for your life and mine.\\nCollins says the first stage of decline is marked by hubris. Pride and\\narrogance, mixed with a false notion of invincibility, lead the mighty to take\\nhuge, ridiculous risks. In our case, that would be borrowing lots of money\\nand not saving any because “ my job is ‘stable.’ I can afford the ‘easy\\n\\npayments’ with my ‘job.’”\\nThis hubris causes sloppiness and denial of risk. Hey, that sounds like me\\ntwenty years ago—right before I went broke. I had been taught a group of\\nmyths—lies—that I accepted as truth about money. I thought the rules of risk\\nand restraint didn’t apply to me because I was so smart. That led me to build\\na house of cards that fell the first time there was a light breeze, much less a\\nreal storm.\\nHere’s the lesson: Just because you see a turkey flying in a tornado doesn’t\\nmean turkeys can fly. Just because some wild-eyed theory of investing,\\nborrowing, and living without cash reserves works in good times doesn’t\\nmean you can survive a storm. Remember, your ways of handling money have\\nto work in good times and in bad.\\nSkinny-Dipping\\nWarren Buffett has a great saying: “ When the tide goes out, you can tell who\\nwas skinny-dipping.” I have taught for years that if you have a bad map, you\\nwill be late for—or completely miss—the party. The principles that you build\\nyour life on will determine your level of success. If you plan your marriage\\naround a bad map, or bad set of assumptions, then it will likely fail. If you\\nhave all the good intentions in the world, but build your financial house on\\nbad ideas, it will fall. I personally experienced this a long time ago. With this\\nlast recession, many more Americans are discovering that their theories about\\nmoney and their assumptions about how money works were wrong. And they\\ndiscovered they were wrong the hard way—through pain.\\nOverspending that doesn’t feel like overspending because things are going\\nwell is still overspending. Using debt to invest in real estate or the stock\\nmarket and the hope of a quick return will cause you to go broke the minute\\nthe market turns. Chasing the next get-rich-quick scam, like the lottery, or\\ninvesting in gold, will always bring you pain. Hiring someone else—like\\nsome debt-settlement company—to fix your life virtually never works.\\n\\nThe myths—lies spread by our culture—that were covered in this book’s\\nfirst two editions have all been proven by this economic downturn. If you live\\nthe way we teach in this book, you will prosper in good times and in bad\\ntimes.\\nI have a friend that we will call Chris. Chris told me an interesting story in\\nthe middle of the latest recession that illustrates what I am pointing out to\\nyou. For thirteen years, Chris worked for a large corporation whose name you\\nwould recognize. He started his Total Money Makeover about seven years\\nago. When I saw him two years ago, he ran up to me with a big smile and\\nbig hug to proudly proclaim that he was “ DEBT FREE!!” including his\\nhome. He had absolutely no debt, and had saved $38,000 in his emergency\\nfund.\\nWhen I saw him again a year later, he had another fun story to share with\\nme. It seems that he and his boss had become best friends over the years that\\nthey worked together. That week, his friend—his boss—came into his office,\\nwith blood drained from his face and his lip quivering, saying, “ I don’t know\\nhow to tell you this, but corporate is making me lay you off.” Chris jumped\\nup from his chair, ran around the desk, gave his friend a big hug, and said,\\n“ Cool! How much is the severance?”\\nThe company gave him more than $70,000 in severance, and he is now\\nstarting his own business—something he has wanted to do for years. He\\nwasn’t stressed, but instead saw only opportunity, because he was ready. As\\nof this writing, he will make almost double his old salary with his new\\nbusiness this year. Wow.\\nHowever, most people live on the other side of the coin. When they get\\nnews of a layoff, they have the blood drain from their faces and it is their lips\\nthat are quivering. If you have lost your job and are struggling, I am not\\npicking on you. I have seen hard times. But I want you to do what I did when\\nI faced pain brought on by my own stupid decisions and lack of preparation. I\\nsaid very loudly, “ NEVER AGAIN!” Next time . . . well, there won’t be a\\nnext time.\\n\\nSo my prayer for you is that, whatever fear or pain you have gotten out of\\nthis last recession, you learn from it. Remember the day when stupid financial\\ntricks were stress tested and came up looking, well . . . stupid.\\nI have met many children of the Great Depression who learned their lessons\\nwell. They are prosperous and take only the carefully calculated risk. They\\nhave seen much, much more extreme economic times than you have seen. But\\nwe can still learn our lessons and not get sucked back into the craziness of the\\nlast few years. It is time for your Total Money Makeover. Are you ready?\\n\\n1\\nThe Total Money\\nMakeover Challenge\\n \\n“ As lost as a ball in tall weeds!” That is exactly how I felt. Although it was\\ntwenty years ago, I can still taste the emotion as if it were yesterday. Out of\\ncontrol, lost, no sense of power, I felt dread creep across the room like the\\nafternoon shadows on a cold winter’s day. Sitting again at the kitchen table\\nwith too much month left at the end of the money, I was not having fun. This\\n“ adult” stuff where a wife looks to you to provide and kids expect to be fed\\nand kept warm was not exactly working. I didn’t feel like some powerful\\nadult; instead, there was a little boy inside me who was very afraid—afraid of\\nthis month’s bills, afraid of this month’s mortgage, and absolutely terrified\\nwhen I considered the future. How was I to send kids to college, retire, enjoy\\nlife, and not live at the edge of money worries?\\n \\nThe “Normal” American Family\\n \\nIt seemed every month I sat at that same table with the same worries, fears,\\nand problems. I had too much debt, too little savings, and no sense of control\\nover my life. No matter how hard I worked, it seemed I couldn’t win. I was to\\nforever be slave to some banker, to the government, and to the “ needs” of my\\nfamily. When Sharon and I “ talked” about money, we ended up in a fight,\\nleaving her feeling afraid and me feeling inadequate. The next car purchase, the\\nnext house, the kids’ college—our entire future seemed out of reach.\\n \\nI had too much debt, too little savings, and no sense of control over my life.\\n \\nI didn’t need a get-rich-quick guy to pump me up or tell me to be positive.\\nI didn’t need a secret formula to riches. I wasn’t afraid of hard work or\\n\\nsacrifice. I didn’t want to “ feel” my way into being “ positive.” I was positive\\nof only one thing: I was sick and tired of being sick and tired. I was tired of\\nsitting down to “ do the bills” and having a heaviness come over me. The\\nhopelessness was overwhelming. I felt like a gerbil in a wheel—run, run, run,\\nno traction, no ground covered; maybe life was just a financial illusion. All\\nthe money came in, all the money went out, and only the names were changed\\nto protect the innocent. I owe, I owe, so off to work I go. You know the drill\\nand all the clichés that go with the drill.\\nOh, some months everything seemed to work, and I thought maybe we\\nwere going to be okay. I could tell myself then, “ Oh well, this is how\\neveryone lives.” Those times offered enough wiggle room that I could\\ncontinue to lie to myself that we were making headway, but deep down, I\\nknew we weren’t.\\nI Did It My Way, and My Way Wasn’t Working\\nENOUGH! THIS STINKS! I finally decided that this nonplan wasn’t\\nworking. If you have ever had any of those feelings, you are going to love this\\nbook, and, more important, you will love your Total Money Makeover.\\nMore than 20 years ago, my wife, Sharon, and I went broke. We lost\\neverything due to my stupidity in handling money, or not handling it, as the\\ncase may be. Hitting bottom and hitting it hard was the worst thing that ever\\nhappened to me and the best thing that ever happened to me.\\nWe started with nothing, but by the time I was twenty-six years old, we\\nheld real estate worth over $4 million. I was good at real estate, but I was\\nbetter at borrowing money. Even though I had become a millionaire, I had\\nbuilt a house of cards. The short version of the story is that we went through\\nfinancial hell and lost everything over a three-year period of time. We were\\nsued, foreclosed on, and, finally, with a brand-new baby and a toddler, we\\nwere bankrupt. Scared doesn’t begin to cover it. Crushed comes close, but we\\nheld on to each other and decided we needed a change.\\n\\nMyths vs.Truth\\nMyth: I don’t have time to work on a budget, retirement plan, or estate plan.\\nTruth: You don’t have time not to.\\nSo after losing everything, I went on a quest, a quest to find out how\\nmoney really works, how I could get control of it, and how I could have\\nconfidence in handling it. I read everything I could get my hands on. I\\ninterviewed older rich people, people who made money and kept it. That\\nquest led me to a really, really uncomfortable place—my mirror. I came to\\nrealize that my money problems, worries, and shortages largely began and\\nended with the person in my mirror. I realized also that if I could learn to\\nmanage the character I shaved with every morning, I could win at money.\\nThat quest, the one that ended with me staring at myself in the mirror, led me\\non a new journey over the last twenty years: the journey of helping others,\\nliterally millions of others, take that same quest to the mirror. Live Events,\\nFinancial Peace University, The Dave Ramsey Show (talk radio and TV\\nshow), and the New York Times best-sellers Financial Peace, More Than\\nEnough, and The Total Money Makeover have enabled me to tell millions of\\nAmericans what I have learned—the hard way—about money.\\nThe Big Challenge: Find a Mirror\\nI have a challenge for you. Are you ready to take on the guy or gal in your\\nmirror? If you are, you are ready to win. I rediscovered God’s and Grandma’s\\nsimple way of handling money. Wealth building isn’t rocket science, which\\nis a good thing for me (and probably you). Winning at money is 80 percent\\nbehavior and 20 percent head knowledge. What to do isn’t the problem;\\ndoing it is. Most of us know what to do, but we just don’t do it. If I can\\ncontrol the guy in the mirror, I can be skinny and rich. We will let other\\nbooks work on the skinny, and I will help you with the rich part. No, there\\n\\nare no secrets, and yes, this will be very hard. Hey, if it were easy, every\\nmoron walking would be wealthy.\\nWinning at money is 80 percent behavior and 20 percent head knowledge.\\nSo my Total Money Makeover begins with a challenge. The challenge is\\nyou. You are the problem with your money. The financial channel or some\\nDVD sets aren’t your answer; you are. You are the king of your future, and I\\nhave a plan. The Total Money Makeover plan isn’t theory. It works every\\nsingle time. It works because it is simple. It works because it gets to the heart\\nof your money problems: you. It is based on a series of prices that must be\\npaid to win. All winners pay a price to win. Some losers pay a price and\\nnever win, and that is usually because they didn’t have the benefit of a proven\\nplan for financial fitness.\\nOrdinary People\\nTens of thousands of ordinary people have used the system in this book to get\\nout of debt, regain control, and build wealth. I’ve scattered their stories\\nthroughout the book. If at any point during your makeover you are tempted to\\nquit or you just need a little encouragement, read one of these stories. These\\npeople have sacrificed for a short period of time so they will never have to\\nsacrifice again.\\nIf you are looking for a road map to get you home, you’ve found it. If you\\nare looking for something easy or fast, you have the wrong book. If you are\\nlooking for a book to help you pass your CPA exam in the area of financial\\nknowledge, you have the wrong book. If you are looking for a writer who has\\nintricate academic theories (that don’t work in the real world), you’ve got the\\nwrong guy. I have many of the academic pedigrees, but I ended up broke. I\\nhave actually twice become a millionaire from nothing. The first time I was in\\nmy twenties, the money was in real estate, and I lost that due to my\\n\\nstupidity; the second time I was not yet forty, but I did the money thing right\\nthat time, and I am debt-free.\\nSHOCKING STATS\\n90% of people in our culture buy things they can’t afford.\\nI often hear about broke finance professors who bemoan that I am way too\\nsimple, or as an e-mailer told me on The Dave Ramsey Show one day, “ You\\nare a one-trick pony.” To those of you who say you have great but unexecuted\\nplans, I say, “ Prove it. I have.” I like the way I’ve built wealth better than the\\nway you haven’t. You will meet people, educated and uneducated, throughout\\nthis book who have won, or begun to win, with money for the first time in\\ntheir lives. The Total Money Makeover works!\\nThe Total Money Makeover Motto\\nThis plan works, but it will cost you. It will teach you to say new words,\\nlike “ no.” In short, your Total Money Makeover will be a personal money\\nmakeover where you learn this motto: IF YOU WILL LIVE LIKE NO ONE\\nELSE, LATER YOU CAN LIVE LIKE NO ONE ELSE. This is the motto of\\nyour Total Money Makeover. It’s my way of reminding you that if you will\\nmake the sacrifices now that most people aren’t willing to make, later on you\\nwill be able to live as those folks will never be able to live. You will notice\\nthe motto all through the book, even across the bottom of the pages. I’m\\nsorry there isn’t an easier path to feature in the motto, but the good thing\\nabout this one is that it works. You can repeat the motto to yourself as you\\npass up a purchase in order to hit your goals. When you work late and are\\ntired, you can say the motto to yourself. Of course, this isn’t a magic formula;\\nI’m not into that. But it does remind you that you will win, and the payoff\\nwill be worth the cost.\\n\\nDum Math & Stupid Tax\\nA False Sense of Security Some people want to buy a new car for the warranty. If you\\nlose $17,000 of value over four years, on average you have paid too much for a\\nwarranty. You could have completely rebuilt the car twice for $17,000!\\nSome of you are so immature that you are unwilling to delay pleasure for a\\ngreater result. I will show you exactly how to get the result you want, so the\\nprice you pay will not be in vain. I don’t want to walk across hot coals\\nbecause it is fun, but if I can be shown how a short, painful walk will do away\\nwith the lifetime of worry, frustration, stress, and fear that being constantly\\nbroke brings me, then bring on the hot coals.\\nYou will win, and the payoff will be worth the cost.\\nEarly on in our marriage, we decided that Kari would stay home with our children rather\\nthan working outside the home. This decision has perhaps disadvantaged us financially at\\ntimes, but it has been the best choice for our family in many other regards.\\nFinancially, we have made some mistakes such as keeping our student loans around\\nbecause of the “low interest” and even leasing a car at one point. To us, credit cards were\\n\\na status symbol, and we had a few. Our debt peaked at about $375,000 (including the\\nmortgage). That’s not the smartest situation to get yourself into when you have four kids\\nand one salary. By the time we got on Dave’s plan, we were ready to work with gazelle-\\nintensity to get rid of our debt! During one six-month period we paid off $57,000 and gave\\n$7,000 to our church. That really encouraged us and kept us going! It was also great going\\nto Atlantis with Dave and Sharon as finalists in The Total Money Makeover Challenge!\\nNow we are debt-free and helping our daughter through her first year of college. We\\nare also saving for retirement at a good rate and building a new house. We enjoy earning\\ninterest now, rather than paying it. We couldn’t have done it without Dave. We pay cash\\nfor everything, and we tell our money where to go. We can’t even tell you the peace and\\nfreedom this has brought our entire family!\\nThe first months were the most painful as we went from credit to cash.But it’s so nice not\\nto be paying for today and yesterday anymore! By following Dave’s Total Money\\nMakeover plan, you will gain peace of mind as you get control of your money. Just\\nremember to stay focused.\\nThe key to our success was both of us getting on the same page at the same time. We\\nnow work together to plan our spending rather than racing to outspend each other. We are\\neach other’s source of strength during weak moments when spending sounds fun again. We\\nhave learned to have FUN talking about money and financial goals.It’s no longer a\\ncontentious subject.\\nOur advice: Honestly assess your earning capacity and live below your means. Be in\\ncontrol of your own destiny and your own happiness!\\nMark and Kari Stolworthy\\n(both age 43)\\nCPA/Systems Consultant;\\nStay-at-Home Mom\\nMy Promise to You\\nMy promise to you is this: if you will follow the guidelines of this proven\\nsystem of sacrifice and discipline, you can be debt-free, begin saving, and give\\nas you’ve never given before. You will build wealth. I will also promise you\\nthat it is totally up to you. The Total Money Makeover isn’t a magic formula\\n\\nto wealth. This system will not work unless you do, and then only to the\\ndegree of your intensity in implementing it. In the following pages, you will\\nmeet many individuals and families who have won many money victories, but\\nnot one of them won until they won the battle with the guy in the mirror.\\nYour situation isn’t your spouse’s fault (well, maybe, but we’ll talk later), it\\nisn’t your parents’ fault, it isn’t your children’s fault, and it isn’t your\\nfriends’ fault. IT IS YOUR FAULT!\\nDave Rants ...\\nSavings without a mission is garbage. Your money needs to work for you, not lie around.\\nMy financial life began turning around when I took responsibility for it.\\nPeople all across America have used these steps to become free, regain a sense\\nof confidence and control, and build a future for their families. Please join me\\non a journey away from the young man I was, the one I described earlier who\\nwas racked with worry, fear, and guilt over money. Take this journey with me\\nto your own Total Money Makeover, but remember, the first part of the quest\\nis confronting the man in the mirror. That man in the mirror is your Total\\nMoney Makeover Challenge.\\n\\n2\\nDenial:\\nI’m Not That Out of Shape\\n \\nSeveral years ago I realized I had let my body dissolve into flab. I had worked\\nso hard for so many years that I had abandoned the care of my physical\\ncondition. The first step to getting into shape was to realize I needed to\\nchange my ways, but the second and equally important step was to identify\\nthe obstacles to getting there. What would stop me from getting into shape?\\nOnce I understood those obstacles, I began a process to lose weight, grow\\nmuscle, and become more fit. Your Total Money Makeover is the same. You\\nneed to realize there’s a problem, but you must also see what could hinder\\nyour move toward financial fitness. The next few chapters will identify some\\nmajor obstacles to YOUR Total Money Makeover.\\n \\nMyths vs.Truth\\n \\nMyth: Debt consolidation saves interest, and you have one smaller payment.\\n \\nTruth: Debt consolidation is dangerous because you treat only the symptom.\\n \\nLook in the mirror. Take a long look. What do you see? Suck in that gut;\\nhold up your chest, and really look at yourself. It doesn’t matter how many\\nangles or poses you take, the mirror is cruel. “ Well, I’m really not that fat,\\nmaybe just a little flabby.” My dad used to say that 90 percent of solving a\\nproblem is realizing there is one. Focused intensity, life-or-death intensity, is\\nrequired for you to reset your money-spending patterns, and one of your\\nbiggest obstacles is DENIAL. The sad thing is that you can be financially\\nmediocre in this country, financially flabby, and still be average. And if the\\ntruth be known, being average, normal, and financially flabby is pretty much\\n\\nokay by most folks’ standards. This, however, is not a book for the wimpy\\namong us. This is a book about winning, about really having something.\\nNinety percent of solving a problem is realizing there is one.\\nWe started out our marriage with absolutely no debt. We lived on a single income, the\\ncars were paid for, and we even had a small amount of savings.However, we eventually\\nmade the misguided decision to move into a much larger house that stretched us\\nfinancially.After a few years, I changed jobs and we increased our annual income—giving\\nus the illusion that we could increase our standard of living. That is when the debt really\\nstarted accumulating. We financed two NEW cars to replace our old ones.We started\\nbuying everything on credit. We even got a home equity loan. Before we realized it, we\\nwere buried in debt!\\nKelley saw The Total Money Makeover in our local bookstore and bought it as a\\nFather’s Day gift for me. By Independence Day, we had declared war on our debt! We\\nhad $6,000 in savings but $16,000 in debt, not including our house. The plan required us to\\ntake out $5,000 from our savings to put toward our debt—leaving us with the $1,000 Baby\\nEmergency Fund. It was tough seeing our hard-earned savings disappear, but it really\\nhelped our Debt Snowball get rolling.We sacrificed in other areas, and in just ten months\\nwe paid off all of our consumer debt!\\nDave helped us realize that we had to draw the line and stop living beyond our means.\\n\\nInstead of having to pay our creditors each month, we can finally start paying ourselves\\nand investing in our future!\\nMark (age 40) and\\nKelley (age 39) Reep\\nCivil Engineer;\\nNursing School Student\\nDon’t Wait to Have Denial Knocked Out of You\\nFor several years I have spoken multiple times a year to live audiences of two\\nthousand to twelve thousand people, teaching them the ideas in this book.\\nAfter one live event where I spoke to four thousand people, Sara told me that\\nher Total Money Makeover came only after life placed a call to her. She said\\nshe had heard me quote the Wall Street Journal as reporting that 70 percent of\\nAmericans live paycheck to paycheck, but she honestly thought she was in the\\n30 percent who were fine. She had financially struck a pose, and the pose was\\ndenial.\\nDave Rants ...\\nFor your own good, for the good of your family and your future, grow a backbone.\\nWhen something is wrong, stand up and say it is wrong, and don’t back down.\\nWith two sons from her previous marriage, Sara had just remarried and was\\nhappy and secure in her job, as was her husband, John. Their new life together\\nseemed awesome. Their household combined income was about $75,000 per\\nyear, with the “ normal” debts of a small student loan, a car loan, and “ only”\\n$5,000 on a credit card. With life under control and even going well, Sara and\\nJohn decided their new family needed a new home, so the builder was selected\\nand construction began. Somewhere deep inside there may have been\\nuneasiness, but it was very deep. Finally the day came when the new home\\nwas complete. Everything was going to be fine now, the new family in the\\n\\nnew home, the way it is “ supposed” to be. In May they moved into the new\\nhome, complete with big new payments.\\nDum Math & Stupid Tax\\nWasher & Dryer for Sale—$1,800!\\nYes, that’s correct, and you, too, can get this sweet deal. Just head on down to your local\\nrent-to-own store.\\nIn September Sara’s boss asked to see her in his office. She was excelling at\\nwork and braced herself for a big “ atta, girl” followed by a nice bonus or raise.\\nInstead, the boss explained her job was being eliminated. “ Downsizing, you\\nknow,” he said. Her life’s work was cut from her—and $45,000 of their\\n$75,000 income—with the boss’s chilling words. Not only was her pride hurt\\nand her career path cut short, a creeping terror grew deep down inside as she\\ndrove home to tell John. That night there were tears, fears, and the sudden\\nstark realization that she and John were financially fat. Suddenly, Sara and her\\nfamily were facing foreclosure on the house and repossession of the car. The\\nbasics of life had become precious.\\nSara and John had listened to The Dave Ramsey Show on the radio, but\\nthey always thought someone else needed a Total Money Makeover. After all,\\nthey always held their stomachs in when standing in front of the mirror. The\\nnight after her layoff was the first night they looked in the financial mirror and\\nsaw fat people. The sight wasn’t pretty—big house payments, fat car\\npayments, large student loans, bloated credit cards, anorexic savings, and no\\nbudget. They saw fat people.\\nWhen you are physically fat, it is hard to be in denial, because there is the\\never-widening belt line. When you are financially fat, however, you can fake it\\nand look good for a while. Your friends and family will participate in your\\nfantasy/denial, which makes you believe you are doing just fine. One of the\\n\\nfour major factors that keep people from winning in money by getting a Total\\nMoney Makeover is not realizing they need one. Sadly, some of the most\\ndramatic makeovers I’ve seen have been by people who had life smack them\\nso hard they got the denial knocked out of them, like Sara. If life isn’t\\nsmacking you around at the moment, you are actually in greater danger than\\nSara and John the night of the layoff. You are a real candidate for financial\\nmediocrity or even a major crisis brought on by denial, and you have to see\\nthe need to make dramatic changes. If you are apathetic because everything\\nseems “ just fine,” then you will be unwilling to make the huge changes\\nneeded to get huge results.\\nYou have to see the need to make dramatic changes.\\nMmm . . . Frog Legs\\nYears ago, in a motivational seminar by the master, Zig Ziglar, I heard a story\\nabout how mediocrity will sneak up on you. The story goes that if you drop a\\nfrog into boiling water, he will sense the pain and immediately jump out.\\nHowever, if you put a frog in room-temperature water, he will swim around\\nhappily, and as you gradually turn the water up to boiling, the frog will not\\nsense the change. The frog is lured to his death by gradual change. We can\\nlose our health, our fitness, and our wealth gradually, one day at a time. It\\nmight be a cliché, but that’s because it is true: The enemy of “ the best” is not\\n“ the worst.” The enemy of “ the best” is “ just fine.”\\nSHOCKING STATS\\n88% of graduating college seniors have credit-card debt—before they even have a job!\\n\\nI was in denial for a long time about my life and my spending habits. By my mid-twenties, I\\nwas $23,000 in debt and had little motivation to get out of it.My biggest problem wasn’t\\nrealizing how nice it was to be free of financial concerns—it was gambling. I couldn’t stop.\\nEven when I began listening to The Dave Ramsey Show and tried to start attacking my\\ndebt, I often failed. I kept losing my money to the addiction I had—never giving me time to\\nget my feet on the ground.\\nIt took some time, but finally the financial pressures became too much to bear. I knew I\\nneeded a change. I started attending an amazing program called Celebrate Recovery, a\\nministry dedicated to helping people with addictions, hurts, and hang-ups.\\nI also started my Total Money Makeover walking through the Baby Steps one by one.\\nEstablishing my emergency fund was the hardest part because I was still trying to break\\nmy gambling addiction, and that money would always get lost to some game. But, as my\\naddiction weakened and I established a budget, the debt I had incurred became less and\\nless. I moved in with my parents to put would-be rent money toward my final debt.\\nNow I’m saving for a downpayment on a house. I hope to reach my goal by next year.\\nIt is a wonderful feeling to live without the strain of debt on my life!\\nTony E. Newman\\n\\n(age 26)\\nFinancial Analyst\\nThe Pain of Change\\nChange is painful. Few people have the courage to seek out change. Most\\npeople won’t change until the pain of where they are exceeds the pain of\\nchange. When it comes to money, we can be like the toddler in a soiled\\ndiaper. “ I know it smells bad, but it’s warm and it’s mine.” Only when the\\nrash comes will we cry out. I hope Sara’s story and the others in this book\\nwill make you unwilling to stay where you are. If you keep doing the same\\nthings, you will keep getting the same results. You are where you are right\\nnow financially as a sum total of the decisions you’ve made to this point. If\\nyou like where you are, keep it up. Keep in mind, however, why you are\\nreading a book called The Total Money Makeover. Is it because deep down\\nyou have the same uneasy feeling Sara had but didn’t address until it was\\nalmost too late? Are you really looking for something more? If so, I’ve got\\ngreat news. This plan works! Break through the temptation to remain in the\\nsame situation, and opt for the pain of change before the pain of not changing\\nsearches you out. Don’t wait for a heart attack to show you that you are\\noverweight. Cut the carbs, the fats, the sugars, and lace up the running shoes\\nnow.\\nFew people have the courage to seek out change.\\nThe good news about Sara and John was that the financial heart attack they\\nhad made them address their financial eating and exercise habits. The layoff\\nwas a wake-up call and the end to denial. After a year of very hard times, Sara\\nwas able to find a whole new career. Only this time when the checks started\\nrolling in, Sara and John were using this system. Every paycheck became an\\nexciting event because they had a plan. They were financially losing weight\\nand toning up. It wasn’t a quick process, but after following the steps over\\ntime, today they are really winning.\\n\\nThe night I met Sara and John, they were two years into their plan— and\\nsmiling. They told me they were debt-free except for their house, and they had\\n$12,000 in the bank just for emergencies. They had broken through their own\\ndenial, but they made their family uncomfortable because they refused to live\\nlike everyone else. Albert Einstein said, “ Great spirits have often encountered\\nviolent opposition from weak minds.” John’s dad had made fun of their plan\\nand the extra jobs they took to win. He asked if they had joined some cult or\\nsomething. Once Sara and John had realized they were the emperor with no\\nclothes, denial was no longer an option. They also realized all they had been\\ndoing with money to impress others—but no more.\\nSara chuckled as she told me how she used to think: We must be doing\\nwell; all these credit-card companies think I’m creditworthy. If I’m getting\\napprovals from all these banks, I must be okay because, otherwise, they\\nwouldn’t want to loan me money. Besides, I pay my credit cards off every\\nmonth. How could I be in any trouble? I can afford to buy that car or that\\nfurniture if I can afford the payment. John was grinning now, too, as they\\nboth laughed at the language of financially fat people who think they are fine,\\nthe language of denial.\\nAs we closed our conversation that night, Sara told me that while she\\nhoped she or John never lost another job unexpectedly, they are ready if they\\ndo. “ We are no longer living a lie. We know where we are, we know where\\nwe are going, and we know how we are going to get there,” she said. She and\\nJohn wanted to leave me a gift for inspiring their Total Money Makeover, but\\nI assured them they already had.\\n\\n3\\nDebt Myths:\\nDebt Is (Not) a Tool\\n \\nRed-faced and fists clenched, the toddler yells with murder in his voice, “ I\\nwant it! I want it! I want it!” We have all watched this scene unfold in the\\ngrocery store. We may even have watched our own children do this (once).\\nNow that I’m older and more mellow, I sometimes grin a little as a young\\nmom tries without success to stifle the out-of-control screams of a child who\\nis denied something.\\n \\nIt is human nature to want it and want it now; it is also a sign of immaturity.\\n \\nIt is human nature to want it and want it now; it is also a sign of\\nimmaturity. Being willing to delay pleasure for a greater result is a sign of\\nmaturity. However, our culture teaches us to live for the now. “ I want it!” we\\nscream, and we can get it if we are willing to go into debt. Debt is a means to\\nobtain the “ I want its” before we can afford them.\\nJoining in the Lie\\n \\nI have heard it said that if you tell a lie often enough, loudly enough, and long\\nenough, the myth will become accepted as a fact. Repetition, volume, and\\nlongevity will twist and turn a myth, or a lie, into a commonly accepted way\\nof doing things. Entire populations have been lulled into the approval of\\nghastly deeds and even participation in them by gradually moving from the\\ntruth to a lie. Throughout history, twisted logic, rationalization, and\\nincremental changes have allowed normally intelligent people to be party to\\nridiculous things. Propaganda, in particular, played a big part in allowing\\nthese things to happen.\\n \\n\\nDum Math & Stupid Tax\\nFreedom 15 Years Early\\nfor About $250 a Month\\nImagine you buy a $130,000 home, for which you take out a $110,000 mortgage at 7%.\\nThe final cost after all is said and done and paid would be $283,520 after 30 years or\\n$197,840 after 15. The difference? Just $256 extra per month. Go with 15 years!\\nWe have propaganda in our culture today. I’m not speaking in a political\\nsense, but rather recognizing that there are people out there who want us to\\nthink their way and who will go to great lengths to accomplish that. The\\nfinancial and banking industries, in particular, are very good at teaching us\\ntheir way of handling money, which, of course, leads us to buy their products.\\nIf I see an ad again and again that tells me I will be cool and sharp looking if I\\ndrive a certain car, I can fall under the illusion that with the purchase of that\\ncar, those good things will happen to me. We may not really believe that we\\nwill become a model just from purchasing a car, but notice that ugly people\\naren’t used in the TV spots to sell cars. We aren’t really falling for that lie, or\\nare we? I’m just asking. After all, we do buy the car and then justify our\\npurchase on the basis of something academic like gas mileage.\\nWhen we participate in what the crowd identifies as normal, even if it is\\nstupid, we gain acceptance into the club. Sometimes we don’t even realize\\nwhat we are doing is stupid because we have been taught that it’s just “ the\\nway you do it,” and so we never ask why. As we participate in the myth, we\\nlearn to spout the principles of the myth. After the years go by and we have\\ninvested more money and time into the myth, we become great disciples and\\ncan preach the points of the myth with great fervor and volume. We become\\nsuch experts on the myth that we can sell others on joining the lie. I once\\njoined in the lie, but no more.\\nDon’t Let the Monkeys Pull You Down!\\n\\nDebt has been sold to us so aggressively, so loudly, and so often that to\\nimagine living without debt requires myth-busting. We have to\\nsystematically destroy the inner workings of the myths. Debt is so ingrained\\ninto our culture that most Americans can’t even envision a car without a\\npayment, a house without a mortgage, a student without a loan, and credit\\nwithout a card. We have been sold debt with such repetition and with such\\nfervor that most folks cannot conceive what it would be like to have no\\npayments. Just as slaves born into slavery can’t visualize freedom, we\\nAmericans don’t know what it would be like to wake up to no debt. In 2007,\\n7 billion credit-card offers were put in our mailboxes, and we are taking\\nadvantage of those offers. According to CardTrak, Americans currently have\\n$928 billion in credit-card debt. We can’t do without debt, or can we?\\nA major barrier to winning is our view of debt.\\nWorking with tens of thousands of people on their Total Money Makeover\\nin the last several years, I have found that a major barrier to winning is our\\nview of debt. Most people who have made the decision to stop borrowing\\nmoney have experienced something weird: ridicule. Friends and family who\\nare disciples of the myth that debt is good have ridiculed those on the path to\\nfreedom.\\nJohn Maxwell tells of a study done on monkeys. A group of monkeys were\\nlocked in a room with a pole at the center. Some luscious, ripe bananas were\\nplaced on top of the pole. When a monkey would begin to climb the pole, the\\nexperimenters would knock him off with a blast of water from a fire hose. Each\\ntime a monkey would climb, off he would go, until all the monkeys had been\\nknocked off repeatedly, thus learning that the climb was hopeless. The\\nexperimenters then observed that the other primates would pull down any\\nmonkey trying to climb. They replaced a single monkey with one who didn’t\\nknow the system. As soon as the new guy tried to climb, the others would\\npull him down and punish him for trying. One by one, each monkey was\\nreplaced and the scene repeated until there were no monkeys left in the room\\n\\nthat had experienced the fire hose. Still, none of the new guys were allowed to\\nclimb. The other monkeys pulled them down. Not one monkey in the room\\nknew why, but none were allowed to get the bananas.\\nWe aren’t monkeys, but sometimes we exhibit behavior that seems rather\\nchimplike. We don’t even remember why; we just know that debt is needed\\nto win. So when a loved one decides to get a Total Money Makeover, we\\nlaugh, get angry, and pull him down. We Americans are like the last set of\\nmonkeys. With rolled eyes we spout the pat lines associated with the myth as\\nif anyone not wanting to have debt is unintelligent. That person must be a\\nsimpleton, a fanatic, or, worst of all, “ uneducated in finance.” Then why are\\nso many finance professors broke? I think a broke finance professor is like a\\nshop teacher with missing fingers.\\nMyth vs. Truth\\nI want to expose the inner workings of the Debt Myth by looking at many of\\nthe sub-myths. However, I need to warn you to watch out for your instinct to\\ndefend the American way of borrowing. Calm down. Relax and go for a ride\\nwith me for a few pages. I might be onto something. If, at the end of this\\nmyth-busting section, you conclude I’m just a nut with a book, you will not\\nbe forced to change. But just in case the tens of thousands of families who\\nhave experienced a Total Money Makeover have something to say to you,\\nread on in a relaxed state. Let your guard down. You can always put the\\nshields back up later.\\nMyth: Debt is a tool and should be used to create prosperity.\\nTruth: Debt adds considerable risk, most often doesn’t bring\\nprosperity, and isn’t used by wealthy people nearly as much as\\nwe are led to believe.\\n\\nWhen training for my first career in real estate, I remember being told that\\ndebt was a tool. “ Debt is like a fulcrum and lever,” allowing us to lift what\\nwe otherwise could not. We can buy a home, a car, start a business, or go out\\nto eat and not be bothered with having to wait. I remember a finance professor\\ntelling us that debt was a two-edged sword, which could cut for you like a\\ntool but could also cut into you and bring harm. The myth has been sold that\\nwe should use OPM, other people’s money, to prosper. The academic garbage\\nis spread really thick on this issue. We are told with sufficient snobbery and\\nnoses in the air that sophisticated and disciplined financiers use debt to their\\nadvantage. Careful there, you’ll get a sunburn on your upper lip.\\nDebt brings on enough risk to offset any advantage that could be gained through leverage\\nof debt.\\nMy contention is that debt brings on enough risk to offset any advantage\\nthat could be gained through leverage of debt. Given time, a lifetime, risk will\\ndestroy the perceived returns purported by the mythsayers.\\nI once was a mythsayer myself and could repeat the myths very\\nconvincingly. I was especially good with the “ debt is a tool” myth. I have\\neven sold rental property that was losing money to investors by showing\\nthem, with very sophisticated internal rates of return, how they would actually\\nmake money. Boy, what a reach. I could spout the myth with enthusiasm, but\\nlife and God had some lessons to teach me. Only after losing everything I\\nowned and finding myself bankrupt did I think that risk should be factored in,\\neven mathematically. It took my waking up in “ intensive care” to realize how\\ndumb and dangerous this myth is. Life hit me hard enough to get my\\nattention and teach me. According to Proverbs 22:7: “ The rich rules over the\\npoor, and the borrower is slave to the lender” (NRSV). I was confronted with\\nthis Scripture and had to make a conscious decision of who was right—my\\nbroke finance professor, who taught that debt is a tool, or God, who showed\\nobvious disdain for debt. Beverly Sills had it right when she said, “ There is\\nno shortcut to anyplace worth going.”\\n\\nMyths vs.Truth\\nMyth: Playing the Lotto and other forms of gambling will make you rich.\\nTruth: Lotto and Powerball are a tax on the poor and people who can’t do math.\\nWe bought the lie! We lived our lives according to the standards set to “keep up with the\\nJoneses.” Turns out they were broke and living in debt too. My husband and I owed\\n$72,000 on a rental property and $35,000 on credit cards, student loans, and car notes.And\\non top of that, we bought a four-bedroom home complete with a pool that was in need of\\nmajor repairs—all of this on a $40,000 teacher’s salary. But we decided that all of this was\\na good investment in our future. We were so wrong!\\nWe were sick and tired of always having more month than money.We needed a Total\\nMoney Makeover. We sold our rental property and our WAY-too-big house and downsized\\nto something much smaller. We spent two and a half years of focused intensity to finally\\nbecome DEBT-FREE!\\nIf you are living in the bondage of debt, you’re not living. Our marriage is so much\\nbetter, and there is an element of peace that wasn’t there before we had a financial plan.\\nWe feel blessed to have found this information early in our marriage and thankful to have\\nthe opportunity to teach our children to be financially responsible.\\nAlison (age 29) and\\nMike (age 33) Wessner\\nHomemaker;\\nPhysical-Education Teacher\\nI have found that if you look into the lives of the kind of people you want\\nto be like, you will find common themes. If you want to be skinny, study\\nskinny people, and if you want to be rich, do what lots of rich people do, not\\nwhat some mythsayer says to do. The Forbes 400 is a list of the richest 400\\npeople in America as rated by Forbes magazine. When surveyed, 75 percent of\\nthe Forbes 400 (rich people, not your broke brother-in-law with an opinion)\\nsaid the best way to build wealth is to become and stay debt-free. Walgreen’s,\\nCisco, and Harley-Davidson are run debt-free. I have met with thousands of\\n\\nmillionaires in my years as a financial counselor, and I have never met one\\nwho said he made it all with Discover Card bonus points. They all lived on\\nless than they made and spent only when they had cash. No payments.\\nHistory also teaches us that debt wasn’t always a way of life; in fact, three\\nof the biggest lenders today were founded by people who hated debt. Sears\\nnow makes more money on credit than on the sale of merchandise. They are\\nnot a store; they are a lender with some stuff out front. However, in 1910 the\\nSears catalog stated, “ Buying on Credit Is Folly.” J. C. Penney department\\nstores make millions annually on their plastic, but their founder was\\nnicknamed James “ Cash” Penney because he detested the use of debt. Henry\\nFord thought debt was a lazy man’s method to purchase items, and his\\nphilosophy was so ingrained in Ford Motor Company that Ford didn’t offer\\nfinancing until ten years after General Motors did. Now, of course, Ford Motor\\nCredit is one of the most profitable of Ford Motor’s operations. The old\\nschool saw the folly of debt; the new school saw the opportunity to take\\nadvantage of the consumer with debt.\\nYou have probably heard a lot of the sub-myths, which fall in line behind\\nthe big one that says, “ Debt is a tool.” So that we leave no stone unturned,\\nlet’s review and debunk each of the myths spread by a culture that has\\nofficially bought the lie.\\nMyth: If I loan money to friends or relatives, I am helping them.\\nTruth: If I loan money to a friend or relative, the relationship will\\nbe strained or destroyed. The only relationship that would be\\nenhanced is the kind resulting from one party being the master\\nand the other party a servant.\\nThe old joke is that if you loan your brother-in-law $100 and he never\\nspeaks to you again, was it worth the investment? We have all experienced\\nloaning someone money and finding an immediate distancing in the\\nrelationship. Joan called my radio show one day complaining about how a\\n\\nloan had ruined her relationship with one of her best friends at work. She had\\nloaned the lady, a broke single mom, $50 until payday. Payday came and\\nwent, and her friend—someone she used to talk to at lunch every day,\\nsomeone who was her confidante and sounding board—now avoided her.\\nShame and guilt had entered the scene with no provocation. We don’t control\\nhow debt affects relationships; debt does that independently of what we want.\\nThe borrower is slave to the lender; and you change the spiritual dynamic of\\nrelationships when you loan loved ones money. They are no longer a friend,\\nuncle, or child; they are now your servant. I know some of you think that is\\noverstated, but tell me why Thanksgiving dinner tastes different when a loan\\nhas been served. Eating with your master is different from eating with your\\nfamily.\\nJoan was really torn up about losing this friendship. I asked her if the\\nfriendship was worth $50. She gushed that it was worth many times that, so I\\ntold her to call her friend and tell her the debt was forgiven, a gift. The\\nforgiveness of the debt helped her remove the master-servant dynamic from the\\nrelationship. Of course, it would be better if that dynamic had never entered\\nthe scene. I also suggested two stipulations to the forgiveness of the debt:\\nfirst, that the friend agree to help someone in need someday; and second, that\\nshe never loan friends money. Let’s break the myth chain. In Joan’s case, the\\nmyth chain of loaning a friend money will be broken only if they both learn\\ntheir lesson. The lesson is that while it is fine to give money to friends in\\nneed if you have it, loaning them money will mess up relationships.\\nThe borrower is slave to the lender.\\nI have dealt with hundreds of strained and destroyed families in which well-\\nmeaning people loaned money to “ help.” Parents loan the twenty-five-year-old\\nnewly married couple the down-payment money for the first home. It all\\nseems so noble and nice until the daughter-in-law catches the disapproving\\nglances at the mention of the couple’s upcoming vacation. She knows the\\nmeaning of the glances, that she should check with these well-meaning, noble\\nparents-in-law before she buys toilet paper until the loan is repaid. A lifetime\\nof resentment can be born right there. The grandfather loans the twenty-year-\\n\\nold $25,000 to purchase that new four-wheel-drive truck he “ needs.” Of\\ncourse, the loan is at 6 percent, much better than Junior can get at the bank\\nand much better than Grandpa gets from his CD at the bank. Everyone wins,\\nor do they? What happens when Junior loses his job and can’t pay Grandpa,\\nwho is from the old school where you dig ditches till midnight if you have to\\nin order to honor your word? Now Junior and Grandpa are at odds, so Junior\\nsells the truck and pays Grandpa the $19,000 he gets for it. Grandpa hadn’t\\ntaken a lien on the title, so he now expects broke, angry, and unemployed\\nJunior to repay the balance of $6,000. Grandpa will never see his $6,000 or\\nhis grandson again. In some perverted twist of the myth, mixed with shame\\nand guilt, Junior’s mind somehow concocts that this is all Grandpa’s fault,\\nand he abandons the relationship.\\nHundreds of times I’ve seen relationships strained and sometimes\\ndestroyed. We all have, but we continue to believe the myth that a loan to a\\nloved one is a blessing. It isn’t; it is a curse. Don’t put that burden on any\\nrelationship you care about.\\nMyth: By cosigning a loan, I am helping a friend or relative.\\nTruth: Be ready to repay the loan; the bank wants a cosigner for a\\nreason, which is that they don’t expect the friend or relative to\\npay.\\nThink with me for a moment. If debt is the most aggressively marketed\\nproduct in our culture today, if lenders must meet sales quotas for “ loan\\nproduction,” if lenders can project the likelihood of a loan’s going into default\\nwith unbelievable accuracy—if all these things are true, and the lending\\nindustry has denied your friend or relative a loan, there is little doubt the\\npotential borrower is trouble just looking for a place to happen. Yet people\\nacross America make the very unwise (yes, dumb) decision to cosign for\\nsomeone else every day.\\nWe continue to believe the myth that a loan to a loved one is a blessing.\\n\\nThe lender requires a cosigner because there is a very high statistical chance\\nthat the applicant won’t pay. So why do we appoint ourselves as the\\ngenerous, all-knowing, benevolent helper to override the judgment of an\\nindustry that is foaming at the mouth to lend money, and yet has deemed our\\nfriend or relative a deadbeat looking for a place to fail, or at least a loan default\\nlooking for a new home? Why do we cosign knowing full well the inherent\\nproblems?\\nWe enter this ridiculous situation only on emotion. Intellect could not take\\nus on this ride. We “ know” they will pay because we “ know” them. Wrong.\\nParents cosign for a young couple to buy a home. Why do they need a\\ncosigner? Because they couldn’t afford the home! Parents cosign for a teenager\\nto buy a car. Why would parents do this? “ So he can learn to be\\nresponsible.” No, what the teenager has learned is, if you can’t pay for\\nsomething, buy it anyway.\\nThe sad thing is that those of us who have cosigned loans know how they\\nend up. We end up paying them, but only after our credit is damaged or\\nruined. If you cosign for a car, the lender will not contact you when the loan is\\npaid late every month, but your credit is damaged every month. The lender\\nwill not contact you before they repossess the car, but you now have a repo on\\nyour credit report. They will contact you to pay the difference between the\\ndebt and the below-wholesale repo price they got for the car, which is called a\\ndeficit. If the lender did contact you, there is nothing you can legally do to\\nforce the sale of the car, because you don’t own it; you are merely on the hook\\nfor the debt. When you cosign on a house, you will get the same results.\\nAccording to Proverbs 17:18, “ It’s stupid to guarantee someone else’s\\nloan” (CEV). That pretty well sums it up. Just like trying to bless a loved\\none with a loan, many people are trying to help by cosigning, and the result\\nis damaged credit and damaged or destroyed relationships. I have cosigned\\nloans and ended up paying them; one poor guy cosigned for me, and he ended\\nup paying when I went broke. If you truly want to help someone, give money.\\nIf you don’t have it, then don’t sign up to pay it, because you likely will.\\n\\nI see cases of people caught in the cosigning trap every day on The Dave\\nRamsey Show, our radio talk show. Kevin called to complain that a mortgage\\ncompany was counting his cosigning for his mom’s car against him as a debt\\neven though she had insurance that would pay the loan if she died. Of course\\nthey count it, Kevin; it is a debt you are liable for! The mortgage company\\nisn’t worrying about her dying; they are worried about her not paying, which\\nwould require Kevin to make her car payments and then possibly not be able\\nto pay his mortgage.\\nJoe, another caller, was surprised to find he was on the hook for $16,000 on\\na mobile home he cosigned for fifteen years ago. Ten years ago his brother’s\\nmobile home was repo’ed, and the bank sold it for $16,000 less than was\\nowed; now, ten years later, the bank caught up with Joe and wanted its\\nmoney. Joe was angry that this could happen! Most cosigners have no concept\\nof the trip they’ve signed up for.\\nThat sums up cosigning: broken hearts and broken wallets.\\nBrian e-mailed me about his girlfriend’s car. It seems ol’ Brian cosigned for\\na $5,000 car for his sweetie. Sweetie took off with the car, he can’t find her,\\nand, surprise of surprises, she isn’t making the payments. Now, either his\\ncredit shows him as a deadbeat, or he makes payments on a car he can’t find\\nfor a girl he doesn’t want to find. That sums up cosigning: broken hearts and\\nbroken wallets. That’s how cosigning usually goes, so unless you are looking\\nfor a broken heart and a broken wallet, don’t do it.\\nMyth: Cash Advance, Payday Loans, Rent-to-Own, Title Pawning,\\nand Tote-the-Note Car Lots are needed to help lower-income\\npeople get ahead.\\nTruth: These rip-off examples of predatory lending are designed to\\ntake advantage of lower-income people and benefit only the\\nowners of the companies making the loans.\\n\\nLower-income people will remain at the bottom of the socioeconomic\\nladder if they fall for these rip-offs. These “ lenders” (or, as I like to call them,\\n“ the scum of the scum”) are bottom-feeders and legally make themselves rich\\non the backs of the poor or those soon to be poor. The lending rates of these\\ntypes of operations are over 100 percent interest, and if you want to stay on\\nthe bottom, keep dealing with these guys. You know why these types of\\noperations are located only at the poor end of town? Because rich people\\nwon’t play. That is how they got to be rich people.\\nThe Payday Loan is one of the fastest-growing trash lenders out there. You\\nwrite a hot check for $225, dated one week from now, which will be payday.\\nThey will give you $200 cash on the spot. All for a mere $25 service charge,\\nwhich equates to over 650 percent interest annually! Mike called my talk\\nshow recently and was caught in a web of Payday Loans. He had not yet had a\\nTotal Money Makeover and was still spending like always. He kept adding\\nloan after loan until he couldn’t beat the shell game he had created. Basically,\\nMike had borrowed from one trash lender to pay another, and by doing this\\nagain and again, had created a cycle of financial death. He was panicked\\nbecause he was being threatened with criminal charges for writing bad checks\\nby the very places that have a business model based on postdated “ bad”\\nchecks. The sad thing is that the only way out for Mike is to pop the balloon.\\nHe has to stop paying them, close his accounts, and then meet with each\\nlender to work out payment arrangements. That will mean extra jobs and\\nselling things around the house.\\nThis type of business is legalized loan-sharking. Some states, like Georgia\\nand Arkansas, have legally run payday-loan businesses out of their state.\\nOthers, like New York and New Jersey, limit the amount of annual interest\\nthey can charge. Even the federal government recognized the problem and put\\na cap of 36 percent on payday loans made to military personnel. Hopefully\\nother states will follow suit.\\nThe classic Tote-the-Note Car Lot is no better. Most of these transactions\\ninvolve older, cheaper cars. The dealer purchases these cars and sells them for\\na down payment equal to what he paid for the car, so the payments at 18 to 38\\n\\npercent interest paid weekly are all gravy. Tow trucks all over town recognize\\nthese exact cars because the car being sold has been sold many times and\\nrepeatedly repo’ed by the dealer. Every time the dealer sells the car, his return\\non investment skyrockets. The payments could have purchased the car for cash\\nin a matter of weeks; in fact, the down payment could have purchased the car if\\nthe buyer had been a little more savvy.\\nRent-to-Own is one of the worst examples of the little Red-Faced Kid in “ I\\nwant it now!” mode. The Federal Trade Commission continues to investigate\\nthis industry because the effective interest rates in rent-to-own transactions are\\nover 1,800 percent on average. People rent items they can’t possibly afford to\\nbuy because they look only at “ how much a week” and think, I can afford\\nthis. Well, when you look at the numbers, no one can afford this. The average\\nwasher and dryer will cost you just $20 per week for ninety weeks. That is a\\ntotal of $1,800 for a washer and dryer you could have bought new at full retail\\nprice for $500 and slightly used for $200. As my old professor used to say\\nabout the “ own” part of Rent-to-Own, “ You should live so long!”\\nWe buy things we don’t need with money we don’t have in order to impress people we\\ndon’t like.\\nIf you had saved $20 per week for just ten weeks, you could have bought\\nthe scratch-and-dent model off the floor at the same Rent-to-Own store for\\n$200! Or you could have bought a used set out of the classifieds or online. It\\npays to look past the weekend and suffer through going to the Laundromat\\nwith your quarters. When you think short-term, you always set yourself up for\\nbeing ripped off by a predatory lender. If the Red-Faced Kid (“ I want it, and I\\nwant it now!”) rules your life, you will stay broke!\\nIf you use Payday Loans, Tote-the-Note, and Rent-to-Own, please\\nunderstand that you are being destroyed financially. These businesses feed on\\nthe working poor, and you must avoid them at all costs if you want to win\\nwith money.\\nMyth: “Ninety days same as cash” equals using other people’s\\n\\nmoney for free.\\nTruth: Ninety days is not the same as cash.\\nThe silly marketing that America falls for has resulted in this: we buy\\nthings we don’t need with money we don’t have in order to impress people\\nwe don’t like. “ Ninety days same as cash” has exploded in furniture,\\nelectronics, and appliance sales. I recently met a lady who financed her dog at\\nthe pet store. “ But I paid him off early,” she said proudly. Good thing for\\nRover that he was able to avoid the repo man.\\nDave Rants ...\\nWhole Life insurance is a horrible product. Why would you pay someone interest on\\nyour own savings? That’s backward, and it does not make you smart.\\nNinety days is NOT the same as cash for three basic reasons: One, if you\\nwill flash cash ($100 bills) in front of a manager who has a sales quota to\\nmeet, you will likely get a discount. If you can’t get a discount, go to the\\ncompetitor and get one. You do not get the discount when you sign up for the\\nfinance plan.\\nTwo, most people don’t pay off the debt in the allotted time. Nationally,\\n88 percent of these contracts convert to debt—a debt where you are charged a\\nrip-off interest rate of 24 to 38 percent, and they back-charge you to the date of\\npurchase. Please don’t tell me you are the one who is actually going to pay it\\noff. A $1,000 stereo (don’t forget, you didn’t get a discount) will not make\\nyou rich in ninety days. But $1,000 left in a savings account at 3-percent\\nannual interest will earn you $7.50 in ninety days. Wow, some financial\\ngenius you are!\\nThree, you are playing with snakes, and you will get bitten. Marge called\\n\\nmy radio show with this little story. She and her husband purchased a big-\\nscreen TV at a nationally known electronics store. This couple paid off the big\\nscreen slightly early to be sure they would not be tricked into the interest\\nbeing back-charged. No such luck. They had declined the disability and life\\ninsurance (for a charge of $174), but apparently the salesperson had\\nfraudulently initialed the contract in that area, something that happens more\\nfrequently than you think. So although our brilliant couple thought they had\\npaid off the TV, they still had a balance and were charged with the interest\\nback through the entire deal. They were fighting it, but it would take hiring a\\nhandwriting expert and going to court with an attorney to avoid paying a bill\\nunder $1,000, even though they did not owe it. That is disheartening. The\\nlittle game of “ we are going to use your money for free” backfired big-time. I\\nrecently purchased a TV in that exact same store for cash; I got a discount and\\nwalked out with my TV. No hassle, no court costs, no interest, no lies.\\nNo, Virginia, ninety days is NOT the same as cash.\\nMyth: Car payments are a way of life; you’ll always have one.\\nTruth: Staying away from car payments by driving reliable used\\ncars is what the average millionaire does; that is how he or she\\nbecame a millionaire.\\nTaking on a car payment is one of the dumbest things people do to destroy\\ntheir chances of building wealth. The car payment is most folks’ largest\\npayment except for their home mortgage, so it steals more money from the\\nincome than virtually anything else. The Federal Reserve notes that the\\naverage car payment is $495 over sixty-four months. Most people get a car\\npayment and keep it throughout their lives. As soon as a car is paid off, they\\nget another payment because they “ need” a new car. If you keep a $495 car\\npayment throughout your life, which is “ normal,” you miss the opportunity\\nto save that money. If you invested $495 per month from age 25 to age 65, a\\nnormal working lifetime, in the average mutual fund averaging 12 percent (the\\neighty-year stock market average), you would have $5,881,799.14 at age\\n\\nsixty-five. Hope you like the car!\\nSome of you had your nose in the air as intellectual snobs when I\\nillustrated how bad Rent-to-Own is because you would never enter such an\\nestablishment, and yet you are doing worse on your car deal. If you put $495\\nper month in a cookie jar for just ten months, you have nearly $5,000 for a\\ncash car. I am not suggesting you drive a $5,000 car your whole life, but that\\nis how you start without debt. Then you can save the same amount again and\\ntrade up to an $10,000 car ten months later and up to a $15,000 car ten\\nmonths after that. In just thirty months, or two and a half years, you can drive\\na paid-for $15,000 car, never having made a payment, and never have to make\\npayments again. Taking on car payments because everyone else does it does\\nnot make it smart. Will your broke relatives and friends make fun of your junk\\ncar while you do this? Sure they will, but that is a very good sign you are on\\nthe right track.\\nSHOCKING STATS\\nOver 97% of people don’t systematically pay extra on their mortgage.\\nHaving been a millionaire and gone broke, I dug my way out by making a\\ndecision about looking good versus being good. Looking good is when your\\nbroke friends are impressed by what you drive, and being good is having more\\nmoney than they have.\\nAre you starting to realize that The Total Money Makeover is also in your\\nheart? You have to reach the point that what people think is not your primary\\nmotivator. Reaching the goal is the motivator. Do you remember the circus\\ngame where you swing the large hammer over your head to hit the lever to\\nsend a weight up a pole to ring the bell? You reach the point that you want to\\nring the bell! Who cares if you are a ninety-eight-pound weakling with gawky\\nform? The girls are still impressed when the bell is rung. When the goal, not\\nhow you look, begins to matter, you are on your way to a Total Money\\n\\nMakeover.\\nToday I drive very nice, very expensive, slightly used cars, but it wasn’t\\nalways that way. After going broke, I drove a borrowed 400,000-mile Cadillac\\nwith a vinyl roof torn loose so that it filled up with air like a parachute. The\\npredominant color on this car was Bondo. I drove the Bondo buggy for what\\nfelt like ten years during one three-month period. I had dropped from a Jaguar\\nto a borrowed Bondo buggy! This was not fun, but I knew that if I would live\\nlike no one else, later I could live like no one else. Today I am convinced that\\nmy wife and I are able to do anything we want financially partially because of\\nthe car sacrifices we made in the early days. I believe, with everything within\\nme, that we are winning because of the heart change that allowed us to drive\\nold, beat-up cars in order to win. If you insist on driving new cars with\\npayments your whole life, you will literally blow a life’s fortune on them. If\\nyou are willing to sacrifice for a while, you can have your life’s fortune and\\ndrive quality cars. I’d opt for the millionaire’s strategy.\\nMyth: Leasing a car is what sophisticated people do. You should\\nlease things that go down in value and take the tax advantage.\\nTruth: Consumer advocates, noted experts, and a good calculator\\nwill confirm that the car lease is the most expensive way to\\noperate a vehicle.\\nConsumer Reports, Smart Money magazine, and my calculator tell me that\\nleasing a car is the worst possible way to acquire a vehicle. In effect, you are\\nrenting to own. The cost of capital, which is the interest rate, is extremely\\nhigh, yet most new car deals this year will be a fleece . . . I mean, a lease.\\nThey’re baaaadd! Sorry, that’s my impression of a sheep getting “ fleeced.”\\nThe auto industry lobbyists are so powerful that the law does not require full\\nlender disclosure. The industry argues that you are merely renting, which you\\nare, so they shouldn’t be required to show you the actual effective interest rate.\\nThe Federal Trade Commission requires a truth-in-lending statement when\\nyou buy a car or get a mortgage, but not on a lease, so you don’t know what\\n\\nyou are paying unless you are very good with a calculator. Having seen\\nseveral hundred lease agreements entered into by people I have counseled, my\\nfinancial calculator confirms that the average interest rate is 14 percent.\\nMost new car deals this year will be a fleece . . . I mean, a lease.\\nShouldn’t you lease or rent things that go down in value? Not necessarily,\\nand the math doesn’t work on a car, for sure. Follow me through this\\nexample: If you rent (lease) a car with a value of $22,000 for three years, and\\nwhen you turn it in at the end of that three-year lease the car is worth $10,000,\\nsomeone has to cover the $12,000 loss. You’re not stupid, so you know that\\nGeneral Motors, Ford, or any of the other auto giants aren’t going to put\\ntogether a plan to lose money. Your fleece/lease payment is designed to cover\\nthe loss in value ($12,000 spread over 36 months is equal to $333 per\\nmonth), plus provide profit (the interest you pay).\\nWhere did you get a deal in that? You didn’t! On top of that, there is the\\ncharge of 10 to 17 cents per mile for going over the allotted miles and the\\npenalties everyone turning in a lease has experienced for “ excessive wear and\\ntear,” which takes into account every little nick, dent, carpet tear, smudge, or\\nsmell. You end up writing a large check just to walk away after renting your\\ncar. The whole idea of the back-end penalties is twofold: to get you to\\nfleece/lease another one so you can painlessly roll the gotchas into the new\\nlease, and to make sure the car company makes money.\\nSmart Money magazine quotes the National Auto Dealers Association\\n(NADA) as stating the average new car purchased for cash makes the dealer an\\n$82 profit. When the dealer can get you to finance with them, they sell the\\nfinancing contract and make an average of $775 per car! But if they can get you\\nto fleece the car, the dealer can sell that fleece to the local bank or GMAC,\\nFord Motor Credit, Toyota Credit, etc., for an average of $1,300! The typical\\ncar dealer makes their money in the finance office and the shop, not in the sale\\nof new cars.\\nCar fleecing is exploding because dealers know it is their largest profit\\n\\ncenter. We live in a culture that quit asking, “ How much?” and instead asks,\\n“ How much down, and how much a month?” If you look at only the monthly\\noutlay, then you will always fleece, because it almost always costs less down\\nand less a month, but in the long run, it is much more expensive. Once again,\\nthe Red-Faced Kid bought something he couldn’t afford using an unwise\\nmethod and then attempted to justify his stupidity. That red-faced stuff won’t\\nwork if you want a Total Money Makeover.\\nCraig called my radio show to argue about leasing because his CPA said he\\nshould lease a car. (Proof that some CPAs can’t add, or at least don’t take the\\ntime to!) Craig owned his own business and thought the tax write-off if his\\nbusiness owned the car made fleecing smart. Craig had the $20,000 cash to\\nbuy a one-year-old car just like the one he wanted, but instead he was going\\nto fleece a new $30,000 one. He missed two important points. First, 98\\npercent of fleecing is done on a new car, which rapidly loses value, not a wise\\nbusiness decision. Second, creating an unneeded business expense for the sake\\nof a tax write-off is bad math.\\nLet’s say that Craig fleeced a car for $416 per month, $5,000 per year, and\\nused it 100 percent for business (which is highly unlikely and most times\\nwon’t survive an audit). If you have a tax write-off of $5,000, you don’t pay\\ntaxes on that money. If Craig didn’t have the $5,000 write-off, he would pay\\ntaxes on that $5,000, which would be about $1,500 in taxes. So Craig’s\\nCPA’s suggestion that he send the car company $5,000 to keep from sending\\nthe government $1,500 sounds as though he can’t add. Plus, Craig now is\\nresponsible for a $30,000 car that is dropping in value instead of a $20,000 car\\nthat took the worst drop in value during its first year.\\nMy company owns my cars. We are able to straight-line depreciate those\\ncars or write off the mileage. If you drive inexpensive cars in your business\\nand put high mileage on them, take the mileage deduction. If you, like me,\\ndrive expensive cars but do not put many miles on them, take the straight-line\\ndepreciation. Both tax deductions are available to you without having a stupid\\ncar payment. If you don’t own a business and didn’t understand everything I\\njust said about tax write-offs, etc., don’t worry. Just know that, as a wise\\n\\nbusiness owner, you don’t want to fleece a car.\\nMyth: You can get a good deal on a new car at 0 percent interest.\\nTruth: A new car loses 60 percent of its value in the first four years;\\nthat isn’t 0 percent.\\nWe have discussed the new-car purchase in its various forms for the last\\nseveral pages. No, you can’t afford a new car unless you are a millionaire and\\ncan, therefore, afford to lose thousands of dollars, all in the name of the neat\\nnew-car smell. A good used car that is less than three years old is as reliable\\nor more reliable than a new car. A new $28,000 car will lose about $17,000 of\\nvalue in the first four years you own it. That is almost $100 per week in lost\\nvalue. To understand what I’m talking about, open your window on your way\\nto work once a week and throw out a $100 bill.\\nThe average millionaire drives a two-year-old car with no payments.\\nThe average millionaire drives a two-year-old car with no payments. He or\\nshe simply bought it. The average millionaire is unwilling to take the loss\\nthat a new car dishes out; that is how they became millionaires. I am not\\nsaying you will never drive a brand-new car, but until you have so much\\nmoney you can lose big bucks and not notice, you can’t afford the luxury.\\nThe car dealer will tell you that you are “ buying someone else’s problems.”\\nThen why do they sell used cars? Wouldn’t that be morally wrong? The\\ntruth is that most slightly used cars have gotten all the kinks worked out of\\nthem and were not traded because they were bad cars. Since almost 80 percent\\nof the new cars this year will be fleeced, more than likely you are buying a car\\nthat came off a lease. My last two car purchases were one- and two-year lease\\nturn-ins with low miles.\\nIf you understand what I am saying about this huge loss in value, you now\\nrealize that 0 percent interest isn’t really “ no cost.” While the money to\\n\\nborrow isn’t technically costing you, you are losing so much in value that\\nyou have still been taken. Zero percent, however, is used quite often by guys\\n(seldom gals) to rationalize their “ need” for some new wheels. So even\\nthough the interest rate is attractive, pass it up because the whole transaction\\nstill means throwing $100 bills out the window each week.\\nSome people want to buy a new car for the warranty. If you lose $17,000 of\\nvalue over four years, on average you have paid too much for a warranty. You\\ncould have completely rebuilt the car twice for $17,000! Also, keep in mind\\nthat most manufacturers’ warranties will still cover you when buying a\\nslightly used car. Of course, when you begin your Total Money Makeover,\\nyou may have an old beater, but the goal is to avoid the temptation of the 0\\npercent interest myth and get into quality used cars. (Still want to buy a new\\ncar? Sure they look great, smell great, and drive great—but the month-after-\\nmonth and year-after-year payments definitely don’t feel great.)\\nMyth: You should get a credit card to build your credit.\\nTruth: You won’t use credit with your Total Money Makeover,\\nexcept maybe for a mortgage, and you don’t need a credit card\\nfor that.\\nThe best myth is the “ build your credit” myth. Bankers, car dealers, and\\nunknowledgeable mortgage lenders have told America for years to “ build your\\ncredit.” This myth means we have to get debt so we can get more debt\\nbecause debt is how we get stuff. Those of us who have had a Total Money\\nMakeover have found that cash buys stuff better than debt. But if I were selling\\ndebt, as the banker is, I also would tell you to get debt to get more debt. This\\nis, however, a myth.\\nYes, you will need to “ build your credit” by borrowing and repaying debt\\nin a timely fashion if you want to live a life of credit cards, student loans, and\\ncar payments. Not me. The one question we must answer is, “ How do I get a\\nhome mortgage?” Later, I will introduce you to the 100-percent-down plan, or\\n\\nif you must, how to settle for a fifteen-year fixed-rate mortgage. But if you\\nwant that fifteen-year fixed rate with a payment that is no more than 25 percent\\nof your take-home pay so I won’t yell about it, don’t you need credit? No.\\nYou can get a mortgage if you have lived right.\\nYou will need to find a mortgage company that does actual underwriting.\\nThat means they are professional enough to process the details of your life\\ninstead of using only a FICO score (lending for dummies). You can get a\\nmortgage if you have lived right. Let me define “ lived right.”\\nYou can qualify for a Conventional fifteen-year fixed-rate loan if:\\n• You have paid your landlord early or on time for two years.\\n• You have been in the same career field for two years.\\n• You have a good down payment, which is more than “ nothing down.”\\n• You have no other credit, good or bad.\\n• You are not trying to take too big a loan. A payment that totals 25\\npercent of take-home pay is conservative and will help you qualify.\\nThe FICO score is an “ I Love Debt” score. According the FICO Web site,\\nyour FICO score is determined by:\\n35% Debt Payment History\\n30% Debt Levels\\n15% Length of Debt\\n\\n10% New Debt\\n10% Type of Debt\\nSo if you quit borrowing money you will lose your FICO score. It is not a\\nscore that says you are winning with money or that you have a million\\ndollars; it mathematically says you LOVE DEBT. Please don’t brag about\\nyour FICO score, that makes you look like you love playing kissy face with\\nsome bank. Dumb, dumb, dumb.\\nSo can you get a mortgage without a FICO score? Many mortgage\\ncompanies have gotten so lazy that FICO is the only lending they do. Others\\nsimply don’t know how to write a loan without a score. But as of this\\nwriting, you can still get a mortgage with a zero score. You don’t want to\\nhave a low score; it is best to have a high one or none at all. My personal\\nscore, by the way, is zero—because I haven’t borrowed any money in decades.\\nMyth: You need a credit card to rent a car, check into a hotel, or\\nbuy online.\\nTruth: A debit card will do all that.\\nThe Visa debit card or other check cards that are connected to your checking\\naccount give you the ability to do virtually anything a credit card will do. I\\ncarry a debit card on my personal account and one on my business and do not\\nhave one credit card. Of course, you must have money before you can buy\\nsomething with a debit card, but paying for things with money you have now\\nis part of your Total Money Makeover. Some rental-car places don’t take\\ndebit cards, but most do. Even though most will take the debit card, you need\\nto check with the specific rental location in advance. I buy things online and\\nstay in hotels using my debit card all the time. In fact, I travel all over the\\nnation several times a year speaking and doing appearances, and my debit card\\nallows me access to the best things life has to offer with no debt.\\n\\nRemember, there is one thing the debit card won’t do: get you into debt.\\nMyth: The debit card has more risk than a credit card.\\nTruth: Nope.\\nSome of you were concerned when I mentioned buying things online and\\nreserving hotels with a debit card. The perception is that it’s riskier to\\nconduct that kind of business with a debit card. Supposed financial experts\\nhave spread this myth to the point that it is virtually urban legend. The fact\\nis, Visa’s regulations require the card-issuing bank to afford the debit card the\\nexact same protections in cases of theft or fraud. If you have any doubt, read\\nthe liability information on Visa’s own Web site. I contacted Visa directly\\nand they sent this statement:\\nVisa’s Zero Liability policy covers all Visa credit—and debit-card transactions processed\\nover the Visa network. Visa extends the same protections and benefits to its debit cards as\\nit does to credit cards—including the ability for credit card issuers to resolve merchant\\ndisputes on the cardholder’s behalf if goods were defective or weren’t received, you\\nwere overcharged, or for other reasons.\\nBut remember, in order to get the full protection, be sure to run your card\\nas a credit transaction—not using your PIN number. That’s what I do.\\nMyth: If you pay off your credit card every month, you get the free\\nuse of someone else’s money.\\nTruth: CardTrak says that 60 percent of people don’t pay off their\\ncredit cards every month.\\nAs I said, when you play with snakes, you get bitten. I have heard all the\\nbait put out there to lure the unsuspecting into the pit. A free hat, airline\\nmiles, brownie points back, free use of someone else’s money, a discount at\\n\\nthe register—the list goes on to get you to sign up for a credit card. Have you\\never asked why they work so hard to get you involved? The answer is that\\nyou lose and they win.\\nWhen you play with snakes, you get bitten.\\nYou won’t wear the hat, and according to MSNBC.com, 90 percent of the\\nairline miles are never redeemed. Next time you are in the store that gave you\\na discount for signing up for a card, you will have forgotten your cash, you’ll\\nuse the card, and the cycle begins. Maybe you think, I pay mine off, so I’m\\nusing their money. I’m winning. Wrong again. A study of credit card use at\\nMcDonald’s found that people spent 47 percent more when using credit\\ninstead of cash. It hurts when you spend cash; therefore you spend less.\\nThe big question is, what do millionaires do? They don’t get rich with free\\nhats, brownie points, air miles, and the use of someone else’s money. What\\ndo broke people do? They use credit cards. An American Bankruptcy Institute\\nstudy of bankruptcy filers reveals that 69 percent of filers say credit-card debt\\ncaused the bankruptcy. Broke people use credit cards; rich people don’t. I rest\\nmy case.\\nBefore getting onboard with Dave’s plan, I was so stressed with work and our financial\\n\\nsituation that I ended up in the hospital with chest pains. My wife and I were making very\\ngood money in the San Francisco Bay area, having nothing to show for it but lives under\\nconstant pressure. For years we had desired to move closer to our children and\\ngrandchildren, parents, and siblings. But the debt we carried would not allow us to move to\\na possibly lower-paying situation.\\nBy the time we found The Dave Ramsey Show on our daily long commutes to work, we\\nwere $95,000 in debt. It didn’t take long for us to realize that he spoke truths laced with a\\nstrong dose of common sense. We destroyed the credit cards and set up a plan of attack\\nfollowing the baby steps as outlined in The Total Money Makeover. W e paid off all\\nconsumer debt and cars within eighteen months, saved our six-month emergency fund, and\\nhad a plan to pay off the house within seven years.\\nA funny thing happened once we got rid of all that consumer debt; the stressful jobs\\nwere no longer a financial necessity. We didn’t feel so much pressure on our lives either,\\nand for the first time we could see a very bright light as we came out of the tunnel. Through\\nDave, God answered our prayers and allowed us to see clearly how we could move closer\\nto our family!\\nWe are now totally debt-free, including our home. We see family weekly and get to take\\npart in all those wonderful events we had missed over the years. We are still saving 15\\npercent of our income and give with joy to church and charities in hopes that we can repay\\nthose blessings we have received and continue to receive.\\nWe tell everyone who will listen to us about Dave and this great gift of financial peace.\\nGetting rid of our credit cards and eliminating our outstanding debt on those cards freed us\\nup to a point financially where we could take a pay cut and focus more on the things that\\nreally matter. My wife and I were happy before, but now we feel true joy in our lives.\\nAlan (age 48) and\\nLonnie (age 47) Cluff\\nBoth in Information\\nTechnology Management\\nMyth: Make sure your teenager gets a credit card so he or she will\\nlearn to be responsible with money.\\nTruth: Getting a credit card for your teenager is an excellent way to\\nteach him or her to be financially irresponsible. That’s why teens\\n\\nare now the number-one target of credit-card companies.\\nThe past several pages have been devoted to the evils of credit cards, so I’m\\nnot going to repeat myself in the case of teenagers. I’ll only add that throwing\\nyour teen into a pool of sharks is a sure way to guarantee a life- time of\\nheartache for them and for you. I will also tell you that over 88 percent of\\ngraduating college seniors have credit-card debt before they even have a job!\\nThe credit-card marketers have done such a thorough job that a credit card is\\nseen as a rite of passage into adulthood. American teens view themselves as\\nadults if they have a credit card, a cell phone, and a driver’s license. Sadly,\\nnone of these “ accomplishments” are in any way associated with real\\nadulthood.\\nYou are not teaching your sixteen-year-old child to spend responsibly when you give\\nhim a credit card.\\nYou are not teaching your sixteen-year-old child to spend responsibly when\\nyou give him a credit card any more than you are teaching gun responsibility\\nby letting him sleep with a loaded automatic weapon with the safety off. In\\nboth cases, you as a parent are being stupid. People with common sense don’t\\ngive sixteen-year-olds beer to teach them how to hold their liquor. By giving\\na teenager a credit card, the parent, the one with supposed credibility,\\nintroduces a financially harmful substance and endorses its use, which is dumb\\nbut unfortunately very normal in today’s families. Parents must instead teach\\nthe teenager to just say no. Anyone visiting a college campus in recent years\\nhas been shocked at the aggressive and senseless marketing of credit cards to\\npeople who don’t have jobs. The results can be devastating. Two college\\nstudents in Oklahoma gave up on their credit-card debt and committed suicide\\nwith the bills lying on the bed beside them.\\n\\nIgot my first credit card when I was 18. Getting it felt like a rite of passage into adulthood,\\neven though I didn’t really know how it worked. I’m not sure I even understood that the\\nmoney had to be paid back!\\nI ended up losing my job. The bills started piling up, so I moved out of my apartment\\nand into my truck to save some cash. Then, my truck got repossessed! For far too long, I\\nused my credit cards to buy anything and everything. I wasn’t budgeting at all, and I\\ncontinued to treat credit card cash as income.\\nI got married and debt continued to cause my wife and me a lot of stress and worry. We\\nwere living in Section 8 housing—and my wife was scared to be there alone! We hoped\\nthat disaster wouldn’t strike while we lived paycheck to paycheck. Without a buffer\\nbetween us and life, we never knew when the next emergency would hit us.\\nI heard Dave on the radio, started his Baby Steps, and read The Total Money\\nMakeover. We cut up our credit cards before we had an emergency fund in place, which\\nmade my wife nervous. We paid off $10,000 in debt on a $30,000 combined yearly income,\\nand we are now debt-free!\\nWe rarely disagree anymore when we create a budget. With each paycheck, we tithe,\\npay ourselves first (save!), pay bills, and use the envelope system for our other expenses. I\\nordered 20 copies of The Total Money Makeover and have enjoyed giving them away to\\nmy coworkers so they, too, can experience what it’s like to be debt-free and have cash in\\nhand for purchases. I’ve gone from being completely ignorant about my money to\\n\\nbecoming debt-free and trying to help others gain financial peace!\\nDavid (age 30) and\\nTayelor (age 25) Jarrett\\nTechnical Support Rep/Small\\nBusiness Owner; Clinical\\nAssistant\\nVince called my radio show with a problem that has become a trend. Vince\\nsigned up for multiple cards during his sophomore year at college to get the\\nfree campus T-shirt. He wasn’t going to use the cards unless there was an\\nemergency, but there was an “ emergency” every week, and soon he was\\n$15,000 in debt. He couldn’t make the payments, so he quit school to get a\\njob. The problem was, without his degree, his earnings were minimal. Worse\\nthan that, he also had $27,000 in student loans. Student loans aren’t payable\\nwhile you are in school, but when you leave school by graduating or quitting,\\nthe payments begin. Vince was one scared twenty-one-year-old with $42,000\\nin debt, but making only $15,000 per year. What’s scary is that Vince is\\n“ normal.” The American Bankruptcy Institute reveals that 19 percent of the\\npeople who filed for bankruptcy were college students. That means one in five\\nbankruptcy filings were by very young people who started their lives as\\nfinancial failures. Do you still think it is wise to give a teen a card? I hope\\nnot.\\nThe reason why lenders market so aggressively to teens is brand loyalty.\\nThe lenders’ studies have found that we consumers are very loyal to the first\\nbank that certifies our adulthood by issuing us plastic. When I am doing an\\nappearance and cutting up credit cards, the emotional attachment many people\\nhave to the first card they got in college is amazing. They clutch it like it is\\nan old friend. Brand loyalty is real.\\nSeveral thousand schools across America are using our high-school\\ncurriculum called “ Foundations in Personal Finance.” The results have been\\nstaggering. Teens latch onto The Total Money Makeover before they need\\none. A recent graduate of the program, fifteen-year-old Chelsea, said, “ I think\\nthis class has totally changed my life. Whenever I see someone using a credit\\ncard, I think, Whoa! How could they do that to their life? I always thought\\n\\nyou had to have credit-card payments, house payments, and car payments.\\nNow, I realize you don’t have to.” Very cool, Chelsea.\\nKid-Branding\\nYou have to start teaching kids early because “ kid-branding” is now\\ncommonplace. When my son was eleven years old, I looked at the back of a\\nbox of Raisin Bran and read “ Visa . . . the official card of Whoville . . . from\\nHow the Grinch Stole Christmas.” I was not the target of this ad; my kid\\nwas. Lenders are teaching kids earlier and earlier their message of reliance on\\nplastic. A few years back, Mattel put out “ Cool Shopping Barbie,” which was\\nsponsored by MasterCard. Of course, this “ cool” babe had her own\\nMasterCard. When she scanned her card, the cash register said, “ Credit\\napproved.” There was so much consumer backlash that Mattel pulled the\\nproduct. A few years ago, Barbie came out with the “ Barbie Cash Register,”\\nand apparently this lady does a lot of shopping. The register comes with its\\nown American Express card. Why are these companies selling to our small\\nchildren? Kid-branding intends to influence card choices later in life. This is\\nimmoral.\\nAgain, we decided to combat kid-branding with our own antidote.\\nFinancial Peace Jr. is a collection of aids to help parents teach their children\\n(ages three to twelve) about money. Of course, you can teach the principles\\nwithout the kit, but, either way, they need to learn them. In my home, we\\nused the same techniques to teach our kids four things to do with money. We\\nwanted to create teachable moments so that the kid-branding would be\\ncounteracted by common sense. We teach our kids to work—not like being at\\nsome boot camp, but that doing chores equals money. Our kids are on\\ncommission, not allowance. Work and get paid; don’t work and don’t get\\npaid. It’s just like the real world. Our children put their newly earned money\\nin envelopes labeled Save, Spend, and Give. When a child learns to work,\\nsave, spend, and give under a mature parent’s direction, the child can avoid\\nthe messages that say a credit card equals prosperity.\\n\\nWork and get paid; don’t work and don’t get paid.\\nMyth: Debt consolidation saves interest, and you have one smaller\\npayment.\\nTruth: Debt consolidation is dangerous because you treat only the\\nsymptom.\\nDebt CONsolidation—it’s nothing more than a con because you think\\nyou’ve done something about the debt problem. The debt is still there, as are\\nthe habits that caused it; you just moved it! You can’t borrow your way out\\nof debt. You can’t get out of a hole by digging out the bottom. Larry Burkett\\nsaid debt is not the problem; it is the symptom. I feel debt is the symptom of\\noverspending and undersaving.\\nA friend of mine works for a debt-consolidation firm whose internal\\nstatistics estimate that 78 percent of the time, after someone consolidates his\\ncredit-card debt, the debt grows back. Why? He still doesn’t have a game\\nplan to either pay cash or not buy at all, and hasn’t saved for “ unexpected\\nevents,” which will also become debt.\\nDebt consolidation seems appealing because there is a lower interest rate on\\nsome of the debt and a lower payment. In almost every case we review,\\nthough, we find that the lower payment exists not because the rate is actually\\nlower but because the term is extended. If you stay in debt longer, you get a\\nlower payment. If you stay in debt longer, you pay the lender more, which is\\nwhy they are in the business of debt consolidation. The answer is not the\\ninterest rate; the answer is a Total Money Makeover.\\nMyth: Borrowing more than my home’s value is wise because I’ll\\nrestructure my debt.\\nTruth: You are stuck in the house, which is really dumb.\\n\\nOn today’s radio show I took a call from a desperate man facing\\nbankruptcy. He had borrowed $42,000 on a second mortgage, a home equity\\nloan. Dan’s existing balance on his first mortgage was $110,000, making his\\ntotal new mortgage debt $152,000. Dan’s home was worth $125,000, so he\\nowed $27,000 more on his home than it was worth. He lost his job two\\nmonths ago and luckily has just found a job in another state, but he can’t sell\\nhis home. He had the same job for sixteen years and thought he had security,\\nbut now, just a few months later, he is “ in the soup.”\\nMy suggestion to Dan was that he call the second mortgage rip-off lender\\nand get an acknowledgment of the truth, that there really isn’t any collateral\\nfor the loan. They wouldn’t foreclose in a hundred years, but they will sue\\nhim when the first mortgage company forecloses. So, after asking the second\\nlender to release the lien for whatever proceeds above the first mortgage come\\nfrom a sale, Dan will sign a note and make payments on the rest. Dan will\\nhave payments for years to come on a second mortgage for a home he no\\nlonger owns, but like most folks, his second mortgage was to pay off (move)\\ndebt he already had on credit cards, medical bills, and other life issues.\\nToday, with a job in another state, Dan would rather have all his old debt\\nback and his home where he could sell it easily.\\nMyth: If no one used debt, our economy would collapse.\\nTruth: Nope, it would prosper.\\nThe occasional economics teacher feels the need to pose this ridiculous\\nscenario. My dream is to get as many Americans as possible out of debt with\\na Total Money Makeover. Unfortunately, I could sell ten million books, and\\nthere would still be seven billion credit-card offers per year, so there is no\\ndanger of my working myself out of a job. The best weight-loss program in\\nthe world can never ensure there will be no fat Americans; after all, there are\\ntoo many McDonald’s.\\n\\nWhat would people do if they didn’t have any payments?\\nHowever, let’s pretend for the fun of it. What if every single American\\nstopped using debt of any kind in one year? The economy would collapse.\\nWhat if every single American stopped using debt of any kind over the next\\nfifty years, a gradual TOTAL Money Makeover? The economy would\\nprosper, although banks and other lenders would suffer. Do I see tears\\nanywhere? What would people do if they didn’t have any payments? They\\nwould save and they would spend, not support banks. Spending by debt-free\\npeople would support and prosper the economy. The economy would be\\nmuch more stable without the tidal waves caused by “ consumer confidence”\\nor the lack thereof. (Consumer confidence is that thing economists use to\\nmeasure how much you will overspend due to your being giddy about how\\ngreat the economy is, never taking into consideration that you are going\\ndeeply into debt. If the consumer were out of debt and living within his\\nmeans, the confidence he would have would be well-founded.) Saving and\\ninvesting would cause wealth to be built at an unprecedented level, which\\nwould create more stability and spending. Giving would increase, and many\\nsocial problems would be privatized; thus, the government could get out of\\nthe welfare business. Then taxes could come down, and we would have even\\nmore wealth. As that great philosopher Austin Powers said, “ Capitalism,\\nyeah, baby!” Ahhhh, capitalism is cool. Those who are worried about\\npolarization, the widening gap between the haves and the have-nots, need not\\nlook to government to solve the problem; just call for a national Total Money\\nMakeover.\\nDebt Is Not a Tool\\nAre you beginning to understand that debt is NOT a tool? This myth and all\\nits little sub-myths have been spread far and wide. Always keep in mind the\\nidea that if you tell a lie often enough, loud enough, and long enough, the\\nmyth becomes accepted as a fact. Repetition, volume, and longevity will twist\\nand turn a myth, a lie, into a commonly accepted way of doing things. No\\nmore. Debt is not a tool; it is a method to make banks wealthy, not you. The\\n\\nborrower truly is slave to the lender.\\nDebt is not a tool; it is a method to make banks wealthy, not you.\\nYour largest wealth-building asset is your income. When you tie up your\\nincome, you lose. When you invest your income, you become wealthy and\\ncan do anything you want.\\nHow much could you give every month, save every month, and spend\\nevery month if you had no payments? Your income is your greatest wealth-\\nbuilding tool, not debt. Your Total Money Makeover begins with a\\npermanently changed view of the Debt Myths.\\n\\n4\\nMoney Myths:\\nThe (Non)Secrets of the Rich\\n \\nMost Money Myths have to do with a lie about a shortcut or a lie about\\nsafety. We yearn to become healthy, wealthy, and wise with no effort and with\\nno risk, but it will never happen. Why else is the lottery so successful in\\npulling in millions of dollars? Why do people stay in jobs they hate, seeking\\nfalse security? The Total Money Makeover mentality is to live like no one\\nelse so later we can live like no one else. A price has to be paid, and there are\\nno shortcuts. While no one goes looking for needless pain, risk, or sacrifice,\\nwhen something sounds too good to be true, it is. The myths in this chapter\\nare rooted in two basic problems. First is risk denial, thinking total safety is\\npossible and likely. Second is easy wealth, or looking for the magic key to\\nopen the treasure chest.\\n \\nRisk Denial\\n \\nRisk denial takes several forms in the world of money. Sometimes risk denial\\nis a kind of laziness, when we don’t want to take the energy to realize that\\nenergy is needed to win. Other times, risk denial is a kind of surrender in\\nwhich we settle for a bad solution because we are so beat down or beat up that\\nwe wave the white flag and do something stupid. At still other times, risk\\ndenial can have an active component when we search for a false security that\\nsimply doesn’t exist. This is the risk denial of someone who keeps a job he\\nor she hates for fourteen years because the company is “ secure,” only to find\\nlife turned upside down by a layoff when the “ secure” company files for\\nbankruptcy. Money denial always involves an illusion, followed by\\ndisillusionment.\\n \\n\\nQuick, Easy Money\\nThe second underlying problem is the quest for easy wealth. Quick, easy\\nmoney is one of the oldest lies, or myths, in the book of the human race. A\\nshortcut, a microwave dinner, instant coffee, and lottery millionaires are things\\nwe wish would give us high quality, but they never do. The secrets of the rich\\ndon’t exist, because the principles aren’t a secret. There is no magic key, and\\nif you are looking for one, you’ve set yourself up for pain and the loss of\\nmoney. One of my pastors says that living right is not complicated; it may be\\ndifficult, but it is not complicated. Living right financially is the same way—\\nit is not complicated; it may be difficult, but it is not complicated.\\nThe secrets of the rich don’t exist, because the principles aren’t a secret.\\nMyth vs. Truth\\nIn addition to Debt Myths, we must dispel several other Money Myths as part\\nof your Total Money Makeover. Most of these Money Myths are rooted in the\\nproblems we have already discussed: denial and/or a shortcut mentality.\\nMyth: Everything will be fine when I retire. I know I’m not saving\\nyet, but it will be okay.\\nTruth: The Cavalry isn’t coming.\\nHow can I put this delicately? There is no shining knight headed your way\\non a white horse to save the day. Wake up! This is the real world where sad\\nold people eat Alpo! Please don’t be under the illusion that this government,\\none that is so inept and dim-witted with money, is going to take great care of\\nyou in your golden years. That is your job! This is an emergency! The house\\nis on fire! You have to save. You have to invest in your future. You won’t be\\n\\nFINE! Do you get the picture?\\nWe live in the land of plenty, and that has until recently lulled a large\\npercentage of Americans to sleep, thinking everything will be “ okay.” Things\\nwon’t be okay unless you make them that way. Your destiny and your\\ndignity are up to you. You are in charge of your retirement. We’ll talk about\\nhow to take charge of it later in the book, but for now, you’d better be 100\\npercent convinced that this area deserves your full attention right now—not\\ntomorrow or pretty soon. Personally, I don’t want to work at McDonald’s\\nwhen I retire—unless it’s the one I own on St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin\\nIslands.\\nMyth: Gold is a good investment and will cover me if the economy\\ncollapses.\\nTruth: Gold has a poor track record and isn’t used when an\\neconomy collapses.\\nGold has been sold as a stable investment that everyone should own.\\nConventional wisdom intones, “ Since the beginning of time, gold has been\\nthe standard that man has used to exchange goods and services.” After making\\nthat pitch, the mythsayer will follow up with the statement that in a failed\\neconomy, gold is the only thing that will retain its value. “ You will have\\nwhat everyone wants” is how the pitch continues. After hearing these pitches,\\npeople buy gold as an investment under the illusion of false security, or risk\\ndenial.\\nThe truth is that gold is a lousy investment with a long track record of\\nmediocrity. The average rates of return tracked as far back as Napoleon are\\naround 2 percent gain per year. In recent history, gold has a fifty-year track\\nrecord of around 4.4 percent, about the same as inflation and just above\\nsavings accounts. During that same time frame, you would have made around\\n12 percent in a good growth-stock mutual fund. During those fifty years,\\nthough, there has been incredible volatility and tons of risk.\\n\\nWhile gold has done very well since 2001, this is the only five-year period\\nin history that it has seen great rates of return. And most of those returns are\\nbased on the doomsayer emotions brought on by 9/11 and the recession of\\n2008–09.\\nIt is also important to remember that gold is not used when economies fail.\\nHistory shows that when an economy completely collapses, the first thing that\\nappears is a black-market barter system in which people trade items for other\\nitems or services. In a primitive culture, items of utility often become the\\nmedium of exchange, and the same is temporarily true in a failed economy. A\\nskill, a pair of blue jeans, or a tank of gas becomes very valuable, but not gold\\ncoins or nuggets. Usually a new government rises from the ashes, and new\\npaper money or coinage is established. Gold will, at best, play a minor role,\\nand the gold investor will be left with the sick feeling that real estate, canned\\nsoup, or knowledge would have been a better hedge against a failed economy.\\nMyth: I can get rich quickly and easily if I join these groups, buy\\nthis DVD set, and work three hours a week.\\nTruth: No one develops and makes a six-figure income on three\\nhours a week.\\nI received an e-mail recently from a gentleman offering me a 500-to-1 return\\non my money. He stated that he has become so enthused about the prospects\\nof this “ investment” that he has gotten several of his friends in the deal with\\nhim. (Oh no.) He didn’t have a lot of time in his busy schedule, but he would\\nmake time if I would meet with him. No thanks. I don’t know what this is,\\nbut I know it is a scam. I am not cynical, but I do know investments. Odds of\\n500 to 1 don’t come through, and I won’t waste my time discussing them or\\ntrying to find the flaw in the logic. It is a scam, period. Run as fast as you can\\nto get away from these people!\\nDum Math & Stupid Tax\\n\\nThe Answer, My Friend,\\nIs Blowing Out the Window\\nA new $28,000 car will lose about $17,000 of value in the first four years you own it. To\\nget the same result, you could toss a $100 bill out the window once a week during your\\ncommute.\\nAs a younger man I often fell prey to this type of garbage. Later, I used to\\nhave meetings with these guys to try to find the flaw. Now I just shake my\\nhead—because I know he is heading for pain and loss, and so are his friends.\\nHave you seen the midnight infomercial about ordering the DVD set with\\nthe “ secrets” so that “ you, too,” can become wildly wealthy by buying\\nnothing-down real estate or by learning the hidden formula to success in the\\nstock market? Small-business ideas abound, such as getting rich at home by\\nstuffing envelopes and doing medical billings. Be realistic. Envelopes are\\nstuffed by machines at a rate of thousands a minute and at a cost of tenths of a\\npenny; they are not stuffed by a stay-at-home mom trying to supplement the\\nfamily income! One person in every thousand who attempt the oversold,\\noverdone medical-billing concept does so at a profit. The legitimate, profitable\\nmedical biller is usually someone who came from the medical industry, not\\nsomeone who got ripped off taking a weekend course. Don’t fall for this!\\nReal estate can be purchased for nothing down, but then you owe so much\\non it that there is no cash flow. You have to “ feed” it every month. I bought\\nforeclosure and bankruptcy real estate for years and know it can be done, but\\nthe players with cash are the ones who win. The good deals are one in two\\nhundred if you are experienced and very good at the business; I worked sixty\\nhours a week, and it took me years to get to a six-figure income in real estate.\\nThe stock market attracts the brightest business minds on the planet. These\\nmeganerds study, track, chart, eat, and breathe the stock market, and have for\\ngenerations. Still, every other year, a book or con artist comes out claiming to\\n\\nhave “ discovered” little-known keys, patterns, or trends that will “ make you\\nrich.” The Beardstown Ladies published a New York Times best-seller about\\ntheir cute little quilting group who started investing and discovered how to\\nget unbelievable returns. As it turns out, the whole thing was a fraud; they\\nnever got those reported returns, and the publisher got sued. Another book\\nwas published on the Dogs of the Dow, showing a little-known pattern about\\nbuying the worst stocks on the Dow Jones Industrial Average to gain wealth.\\nAs it turns out, the author wrote another book about how to invest in bonds,\\nafter he had discovered his formula didn’t work.\\nIt is really hard to sell books and DVDs that teach the necessity of lots of\\nhard work, living on less than you make, getting out of debt, and living on a\\nplan, but I’m trying—because it’s the only way that will work. Meanwhile,\\nthe sooner you understand that no one gets rich quick by using secret\\ninformation, the better.\\nMyth: Cash Value life insurance, like Whole Life, will help me\\nretire wealthy.\\nTruth: Cash Value life insurance is one of the worst financial\\nproducts available.\\nSadly, over 70 percent of the life insurance policies sold today are Cash\\nValue policies. A Cash Value policy is an insurance product that packages\\ninsurance and savings together. Do not invest money in life insurance; the\\nreturns are horrible. Your insurance person will show you wonderful\\nprojections, but none of these policies perform as projected.\\nNo one gets rich quick by using secret information.\\nLet’s look at an example. If a thirty-year-old man has $100 per month to\\nspend on life insurance and shops the top five Cash Value companies, he will\\nfind he can purchase an average of $125,000 in insurance for his family. The\\n\\npitch is to get a policy that will build up savings for retirement, which is\\nwhat a Cash Value policy does. However, if this same guy purchases twenty-\\nyear level term insurance with coverage of $125,000, the cost will be only $7\\nper month, not $100. Wow. If he goes with the Cash Value option, the other\\n$93 per month should be in savings, right? Well, not really; you see, there\\nare expenses. Expenses? How much? All of the $93 per month disappears in\\ncommissions and expenses for the first three years; after that, the return will\\naverage 2.6 percent per year for Whole Life, 4.2 percent for Universal Life, and\\n7.4 percent for the new-and-improved Variable Life policy that includes\\nmutual funds. These statistics are from Consumer Reports, Consumer\\nFederation of America, Kiplinger’s Personal Finance, and Fortune magazine,\\nso these are the real numbers. Additionally, a recent article in National\\nUnderwriter, The Industry Mouthpiece, showed charts of returns from fourteen\\nnational companies. The returns they show average only 6.29 percent over\\ntwenty years. Either way, this product is a really bad idea!\\nWorse yet, with Whole Life and Universal Life, the savings you finally\\nbuild up after being ripped off for years don’t go to your family upon your\\ndeath; the only benefit paid to your family is the face value of the policy, the\\n$125,000 of our example. The truth is that you would be better off to get the\\n$7 term policy and put the extra $93 in a cookie jar! At least after three years\\nyou would have $3,000, and when you died your family would get your\\nsavings.\\nAs you continue in this book and learn how to have a Total Money\\nMakeover, you will begin investing well. Then, when you are fifty-seven and\\nthe kids are grown and gone, the house is paid for, and you have $700,000 in\\nmutual funds, you’ll become self-insured. That means when your twenty-year\\nterm is up, you shouldn’t need life insurance at all— because with no kids to\\nfeed, no house payment, and $700,000, your spouse will just have to suffer\\nthrough if you die without insurance.\\nMyth: Playing the lottery and other forms of gambling will make\\nyou rich.\\n\\nTruth: The lottery is a tax on the poor and on people who can’t do\\nmath.\\nJust the other day, I was in a lottery state for a speaking engagement. I went\\ninto the gas station to pay for my fill-up and saw a line of people. For a\\nmoment I thought I was going to have to stand in line to pay for my gas,\\nbefore I realized that the line was for purchasing lottery tickets. Have you ever\\nseen those lines? Next time you do, look at the people in the line. Darryl and\\nhis other brother Darryl. These are not rich people, and these are not smart\\npeople. The lottery is a tax on poor people and on people who can’t do math.\\nRich people and smart people would be in the line if the lottery were a real\\nwealth-building tool, but the truth is that the lottery is a rip-off instituted by\\nour government. This is not a moral position; it is a mathematical, statistical\\nfact. Studies show that the zip codes that spend four times what anyone else\\ndoes on lottery tickets are those in lower-income parts of town. The lottery, or\\ngambling of any kind, offers false hope, not a ticket out. A Total Money\\nMakeover offers hope because it works. Remember, I have been broke twice in\\nmy life, but never poor; poor is a state of mind.\\nThe lottery is a tax on poor people and on people who can’t do math.\\nGambling represents false hope and denial. Energy, thrift, and diligence are\\nhow wealth is built, not dumb luck.\\nMyth: Mobile homes, or trailers, will allow me to own something\\ninstead of renting, and that will help me to become wealthy.\\nTruth: Trailers go down in value rapidly, making your chances for\\nwealth building less than if you had rented.\\nTrailers go down in value rapidly. People who buy a $25,000 double-wide\\nhome will in five years owe $22,000 on a trailer worth $8,000. Financially,\\nit’s like living in your new car. If I were to suggest you invest $25,000 into a\\n\\nmutual fund with a proven track record of dropping to $8,000 in just five\\nyears, you would look at me as if I had lost my mind. I am not above living\\nin a mobile home. I have lived in worse. I just know mobile homes are lousy\\nplaces to put money. Please don’t kid yourself on this. If it walks like a duck\\nand quacks like a duck, it is a duck. Call it “ manufactured housing,” put it on\\na permanent foundation, add lots of improvements around the yard, and it is\\nstill a trailer when you are ready to sell it.\\nI want you to own a home because homes are a good investment. The\\nfastest way to become a homeowner is through a Total Money Makeover\\nwhile renting the cheapest thing you can suffer through. The purchase of a\\ntrailer is not a shortcut, but a setback on the path to owning real estate that\\ngoes up in value. If the typical consumer considering buying your home can\\nwalk up and tell it was ever a trailer in any form, your home will go down,\\nnot up, in value.\\nThe only exception to the “ no trailers” rule is Ron’s plan. Ron graduated\\nfrom Financial Peace University and was on track for a Total Money\\nMakeover. Ron and his wife prayerfully decided to sell their nice $120,000\\nhome on which they owed only $50,000. They bought a small farm and a\\nvery used $3,000 trailer. With no payments and an income of $85,000, they\\nsaved and built a very nice, paid-for $250,000 home in just a couple of years.\\nThe appraisal was $250,000, but since they paid cash for the land, they got a\\nbargain. Also, as a contractor Ron built the home for pennies on the dollar, so\\nit didn’t take them long to finish paying for the home. They sold the $3,000\\ntrailer for $3,200; after all, $3,000 trailers have lost about all their value, so\\nthe sale comes down to negotiating.\\nMyth: Prepaying my funeral or my kids’ college expenses is a good\\nway to invest and protect myself against inflation.\\nTruth: Plans for prepaid funerals and college expenses give low\\nrates of return and put money in the other guy’s pocket.\\n\\nWhen you prepay something, your return on investment (interest) is the\\namount the item will go up in value before you use it. In other words, by\\nprepaying, you avoid the price increases, and that is your return. Prepaying\\nitems is like investing at the item’s inflation rate. For example, prepaying\\ncollege tuition will save you the amount tuition goes up between the time\\nyou lock in and the time your child begins his college education. The average\\ninflation rate for tuition nationally is about 8 percent, so prepaying tuition is\\nlike investing money at 8 percent. That is not bad, but mutual funds will\\naverage about 12 percent over a long period of time, and you can save for\\ncollege tax-FREE. (More about college saving later in your Total Money\\nMakeover.)\\nThe same concept is true for prepaid burial plans. If you have gone through\\nthe gut-wrenching exercise of selecting a casket, burial plot, and so on in the\\nmiddle of grief, you don’t want loved ones to experience the same.\\nPreplanning the details of your funeral is wise, but prepaying is unwise.\\nSara’s mom died suddenly, and the grief was overwhelming. In the midst of\\nthat pain, Sara felt they made unwise purchases as part of the funeral\\narrangements, and she vowed not to leave her family in the same predicament.\\nSo Sara, age thirty-nine, paid $3,500 for a prepaid funeral. Again, it is wise to\\npreplan, not to prepay. Why? If she were to invest $3,500 in a mutual fund\\naveraging 12 percent, upon an average death age of seventy-eight, Sara’s\\nmutual fund would be worth $368,500! I think Sara could be buried for that,\\nwith a little left over, unless of course she is King Tut!\\nMyth: I don’t have time to work on a budget, retirement plan, or\\nestate plan.\\nTruth: You don’t have time not to.\\nMost people concentrate on the urgent in our culture. We worry about our\\nhealth and focus on our money only after they’re gone. Dr. Stephen Covey’s\\nbook The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People examines this problem. Dr.\\nCovey says one of the habits of highly effective people is that they begin with\\n\\nthe end in mind. Wandering through life aimlessly will bring you much\\nfrustration.\\nWe worry about our health and focus on our money only after they’re gone.\\nCovey says to divide activities into four quadrants. Two of the quadrants\\nare Important/Urgent and Important/Not Urgent. The other two are “ Not\\nImportant,” so let’s skip those. We take care of the Urgent/Important stuff, but\\nwhat is Important/Not Urgent in a Total Money Makeover is planning. You\\ncan pay the electric bill or sit in the dark, but if you don’t do a monthly\\nspending plan, there is no apparent immediate damage.\\nJohn Maxwell has the best quote on budgeting I have ever heard. I wish I\\nhad said it: “ A budget is people telling their money where to go instead of\\nwondering where it went.” You have to make your money behave, and a\\nwritten plan is the whip and chair for the money tamer.\\nEarl Nightingale, motivational legend, said that most people spend more\\ntime picking out a suit of clothes than planning their careers or even their\\nretirements. What if your life depended on how you managed your 401k or\\nwhether you started your Roth IRA today? Actually, it does— because the\\nquality of your life at retirement depends on your becoming an expert in\\nmoney management today.\\nEstate planning is never urgent until someone dies. You must think long-\\nterm to win with money, and that includes thinking all the way through\\ndeath. More on this later, but just remember, everyone must budget, plan\\nretirement, and do estate planning—everyone.\\nMyth: The debt-management companies on TV, like AmeriDebt,\\nwill save me.\\nTruth: You may get out of debt, but only with your credit trashed.\\n\\nDebt-management companies are springing up everywhere. These\\ncompanies “ manage” your debt by taking one monthly payment from you and\\ndistributing the money among your creditors, with whom they’ve often\\nworked out lower payments and lower interest. This is not a loan as with debt\\nconsolidation. Sometimes people get the two confused. Both are bad, but we\\nhave already covered the debt consolidation loans. However, because America\\nneeds a Total Money Makeover, the debt-management business has become\\none of the fastest-growing industries today. Companies like AmeriDebt and\\nConsumer Credit Counseling Services can help you get better interest rates\\nand lower payments, but at a price. When you use one of these companies and\\nthen try to get a Conventional, FHA, or VA loan, you will be treated the\\nsame as if you had filed a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy. Mortgage underwriting\\nguidelines for traditional mortgages will consider your credit trashed, so don’t\\ndo it.\\nAnother problem with debt management by someone else is that your\\nhabits don’t change. You can’t have someone lose weight for you; you have\\nto change your exercise and diet habits. Handling money is the same way;\\nyou have to change your behavior. Turning all your problems over to\\nsomeone else treats the symptom, not the problem.\\nOur firm does financial counseling and trains counselors around the nation\\nfor referrals. We will not handle your money for you. We lead you into a\\nmandatory Total Money Makeover. We are not babysitters. We have had\\nthousands of clients over the years who have gone to debt-management\\ncompanies for help. When the clerk taking the order couldn’t make the\\nperson’s life fit their cookie-cutter computer program, the customer was\\nadvised to file for bankruptcy. After meeting with them, it was obvious that\\nthe customer wasn’t bankrupt; they just needed radical surgery. Don’t take\\nbankruptcy advice from debt-management companies; you likely aren’t\\nbankrupt.\\nMyths vs.Truth\\n\\nMyth: Everything will be fine when I retire. I know I’m not saving yet, but it will be\\nokay.\\nTruth: The Cavalry isn’t coming.\\nOf the debt-management companies, Consumer Credit is the best. They do\\nthe most thorough job, some branches actually educate, and they are the most\\npowerful in the renegotiation of your debt. You still destroy your credit by\\nusing them, though, so don’t do it; but if I absolutely can’t talk you out of it,\\nthey are the one to use. The worst abuser in this industry has now been put\\nout of business. AmeriDebt was started by Andris Pukke, who, prior to\\nbeginning this business, plead guilty to federal charges of defrauding\\ncustomers in a debt-consolidation loan scam. In spite of this, AmeriDebt grew\\nto revenues of $40 million and spent $15 million per year getting you to use\\ntheir services. They were so blatant in their misleading of consumers that the\\nFederal Trade Commission (FTC) finally stepped in and shut them down.\\nThe FTC says hidden fees and deceptive practices took over $170 million out\\nof Americans’ pockets. In the largest case of this type ever, the FTC took a\\n$170 million judgment against AmeriDebt, who is now in bankruptcy.\\nAndris Pukke is court-ordered to give up $35 million in personal assets to\\nsettle with consumers. There are truly sharks out there.\\nMyth: I can buy a kit to clean up my credit, and all my past\\nmisdeeds will be washed away.\\nTruth: Only inaccuracies can be cleaned from credit reports, so this\\nis a scam.\\nThe Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act dictates how consumers and\\ncreditors interact with the credit bureaus. Bad credit drops off your credit\\nreport after seven years unless you have a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, which stays\\non for ten years. Your credit report is your financial reputation, and you can’t\\nhave anything taken off your report unless the item is inaccurate. If you have\\n\\nan inaccuracy that needs to be removed, you need to write a letter pointing out\\nthe error and ask them to correct this error right away. Accurate bad credit\\nstays unless you lie. Lying for the purpose of getting money is fraud. Don’t\\ndo it.\\nDave Rants ...\\nI am not against the enjoyment of money. What I am against is spending money when\\nyou do not have money to begin with.\\nCredit-repair companies are largely scams. The Federal Trade Commission\\nregularly conducts raids to close down these fraudulent companies. I have had\\nmany callers on my radio show who purchased a $300 kit to “ clean” their\\ncredit. Sometimes the kit tells you to dispute all bad credit and ask to have it\\nremoved even if the item is reported accurately. Don’t do that. The worst idea\\nthe kits push is to get a new Social Security number. By getting a second\\nidentity, you get a brand-new credit report, and lenders will never know about\\nyour past misdeeds. This is fraud, and if you do this, you will go to jail. Do\\nnot pass go; go directly to jail—fraud. You are lying to get a loan, which is\\nnot credit cleanup, and this is criminal.\\nClean your credit with a Total Money Makeover. I will show you how to\\nlive under control and pay cash for stuff so you don’t need credit, and over\\ntime your credit will clean itself.\\nMyth: My divorce decree says my spouse has to pay the debt, so I\\ndon’t.\\nTruth: Divorce decrees do not have the power to take your name off\\ncredit cards and mortgages, so if your spouse doesn’t pay, be\\nready to. You still owe the debt.\\n\\nDivorce happens a lot, and it is truly sad. Divorce means we split up\\neverything, including the debts; however, the debts are not easily split. If your\\nname is on a debt, you are liable to pay it, and your credit is affected if you\\ndon’t. A divorce court does not have the power to take your name off a debt.\\nThe divorce judge only has the power to tell your spouse to pay it for you. If\\nyour spouse doesn’t pay, you can tell the judge, but you are still liable. A\\nlender who doesn’t get paid will correctly report bad credit on all parties to\\nthe loan, including you. A lender who doesn’t get paid can correctly sue the\\nparties to the loan, including you.\\nIf your ex-husband keeps his truck that you both signed for and then\\ndoesn’t make the payments, your credit is damaged, the truck gets repo’ed,\\nand you will get sued for the balance. If you quitclaim-deed your ownership in\\nthe family home to your ex-wife as part of the settlement, you will find\\nyourself in a mess. A quitclaim deed is the easy way to give up ownership in\\nyour home. If she doesn’t pay on time, your credit is trashed; if she gets\\nforeclosed on, so have you. Even if she pays perfectly on the home or he does\\non the truck, you will find that you have trouble buying the next home\\nbecause you have too much debt.\\nIf you are going to leave a marriage, make sure that all debts are refinanced\\nout of your name or force the sale of the item. Don’t have the attitude: “ I\\ndon’t want to make him sell his truck.” If you are that much in love, don’t\\nget divorced; but if you are walking away, make it a complete, clean break\\neven though it’s painful now. I have counseled thousands of people who were\\nbroken financially by ex-spouses and bad advice from a divorce attorney. So\\nsell the house or refinance it as part of the divorce, period. The only other\\noption is mega-risk, and you can count on heartache and even more anger\\ncoming your way.\\nMyth: That collector was so helpful; he really likes me.\\nTruth: Collectors are not your friends.\\n\\nThere are a few good collectors, very few. Almost every time a collector is\\n“ understanding,” or wants to “ be your friend,” there is a reason: to get you to\\npay your bill. The other technique is to be mean and nasty, and you may find\\nyour new “ friend” using all kinds of bullying tactics once you have a\\n“ relationship.”\\nYour Total Money Makeover will cause you to pay your debts. I want you\\nto pay what you owe, but collectors are not your friends. Credit-card collectors\\nare the worst, for they will lie, cheat, and steal—and that is just before\\nbreakfast. You can tell if a credit-card collector is lying by looking to see if his\\nlips are moving. Any deal, special plan, or settlement you make with\\ncollectors must be in writing BEFORE you send them money. Otherwise,\\nyou will find that you don’t have a deal, that they lied. Never allow collectors\\nelectronic access to your checking account, and never send postdated checks.\\nThey will abuse you if you give them this power, and there will be nothing\\nyou can do, because you owe them money. Clear?\\nMyth: I’ll just file bankruptcy and start over; it seems so easy.\\nTruth: Bankruptcy is a gut-wrenching, life-changing event that\\ncauses lifelong damage.\\nKathy called my radio show, ready to file bankruptcy. Her debts were\\noverwhelming, and her cheating husband had left with his girlfriend. The\\nhouse was in his name, as was all the debt except $11,000. Kathy is twenty\\nyears old, and her brilliant uncle, a lawyer from California, told her to file\\nbankruptcy. Kathy is beat up, beat down, and deserted, but she is not\\nbankrupt. When her soon-to-be ex-husband ends up with all the debt in his\\nname, he may be bankrupt, but Kathy isn’t.\\nBankruptcy is life-altering and leaves deep wounds both to the psyche and the credit\\nreport.\\nBankruptcy is not something I recommend any more than I would\\n\\nrecommend divorce. Are there times when good people see no way out and\\nfile bankruptcy? Yes, but I will still talk you out of it if given the\\nopportunity. Few people who have been through bankruptcy would report that\\nit is a painless wiping-clean of the slate, after which you merrily trot off into\\nyour future to start fresh. Don’t let anyone fool you. I have been bankrupt and\\nhave worked with the bankrupt for decades, and it is not a place you want to\\nvisit.\\nBankruptcy is listed in the top five life-altering negative events that we can\\ngo through, along with divorce, severe illness, disability, and the loss of a\\nloved one. I would never say that bankruptcy is as bad as losing a loved one,\\nbut it is life-altering and leaves deep wounds both to the psyche and the credit\\nreport.\\nChapter 7 Bankruptcy, which is total bankruptcy, stays on your credit\\nreport for ten years. Chapter 13 Bankruptcy, more like a payment plan, stays\\non your credit report for seven years. Bankruptcy, however, is for life. Loan\\napplications and many job applications ask if you have ever filed for\\nbankruptcy. Ever. If you lie to get a loan because your bankruptcy is very old,\\ntechnically you have committed criminal fraud.\\nMost bankruptcies can be avoided with a Total Money Makeover. Your\\nTotal Money Makeover may involve extensive amputation of stuff, which will\\nbe painful, but bankruptcy is much more painful. If you take the thoughtful\\nstep backward to get on solid ground instead of looking at the false allure of\\nthe quick fix that bankruptcy seems to offer, you will win more quickly and\\neasily. I know from personal experience the pain of bankruptcy, foreclosure,\\nand lawsuits. Been there, done that, got the T-shirt, and it is not worth it.\\n\\nWe’ve never handled money well at all. I guess that’s a bit of an understatement—we’ve\\nfiled bankruptcy three times!\\nThe first time we filed, we felt like bankruptcy was our only option.Our small-business\\nloan to buy a body shop went from 4% to 22% APR, and we lost all our earnest money.\\nSoon after, my husband had his first heart attack, and other problems seemed to pile on.\\nBefore long, we lost our house and cars.We moved to a different state with four kids, two\\ncats, a dog, a motorcycle, a U-Haul trailer, $800—and no jobs.\\nWe were depressed and felt like failures as we put our life back together. You’d have\\nthought we would have learned our lesson, right?Wrong.\\nInstead of learning from our mistakes, we actually repeated the whole thing again a\\nlittle over a decade later. After an injury due to a fall, my husband was out of work for six\\nmonths. Our income went from $4,000 a week to $400 a week. We racked up credit card\\ndebt and ended up filing bankruptcy a second time. Again, we lost our house and most of\\nour possessions.\\nAlthough the first bankruptcy felt like the end of the world, the second one didn’t upset\\nus too much. We felt like it wasn’t a big deal because we’d been down that road before. So,\\nwe just started over a third time, still making the same bad choices.\\n\\nOver the next seven years, we started a new business, made a lot of poor decisions, and\\nclosed yet another company. Then we filed bankruptcy a third time. After filing, we were\\nashamed and too embarrassed to tell anyone. We had this awful, dirty secret that we hid\\nfrom our family and friends. To make matters worse, all the stress and shame caused my\\nhusband to have two more heart attacks.\\nGoing through the bankruptcy process was horrible. No one will meet your eye in the\\ntrial room. It’s like everyone has the plague and is afraid to talk to anyone. Filing\\nbankruptcy three times made us feel like a fraud. We wondered, What’s wrong with us?\\nWhy do we keep repeating the same mistakes?\\nWhen our son came home from deployment with a mental illness, we became his full-\\ntime caretakers. Money was extremely tight because we were caring for our son on only\\none income—my husband had retired after his third heart attack. We were close to filing\\nbankruptcy for a fourth time when my daughter came to our rescue by introducing us to\\nDave Ramsey.\\nNow, we’re on The Total Money Makeover plan and trying to make a dent in our\\nfinancial mess. It’s tough trying to correct a lifetime of bad decisions and behaviors about\\nmoney! But even though we’ve restarted Baby Step 1 three times, we’ve still been able to\\npay off $26,000 of debt! Finally, we have hope for our future, and we are motivated to help\\nothers so they don’t go down the same path we did.\\nLarry (age 67) and Susan\\n(age 52) Hickman\\nRetired insurance broker;\\nCollection manager\\nMyth: I can’t use cash because it is dangerous; I might get robbed.\\nTruth: You are being robbed every day by not using the power of\\ncash.\\nWe teach people to carry cash. In a culture where the salesclerk thinks you\\nare a drug dealer if you pay with cash, I know this suggestion may seem\\nweird. However, cash is powerful. If you carry cash, you spend less, and you\\ncan get bargains by flashing cash. Linda e-mailed my newspaper column,\\n\\ncomplaining that she would get robbed if she carried cash. I explained to her\\nthat crooks don’t have X-ray vision to look into her pocket or purse. The\\ncrooks assume that your purse is like all the others filled with credit cards that\\nare over the limit. Look, I’m not making light of crime. There’s a chance you\\nmay get robbed, because people do get robbed—whether they carry cash or\\nnot. And if it happens to you, the cash will be taken. But, trust me, you need\\nto be far more worried about the danger of using credit cards than the danger of\\nbeing robbed while carrying cash. Carrying cash doesn’t make you more\\nlikely to get robbed; on the contrary, the mismanagement of plastic is robbing\\nyou every month.\\nWe have already destroyed the myth of credit cards and shown that when\\nyou spend cash, you spend less. When you put together your written game\\nplan, you will find that managing spending categories as part of your Total\\nMoney Makeover is a must to gain control. Cash enables you to say no to\\nyourself. When the food envelope is getting low on cash, we eat leftovers\\ninstead of ordering pizza again.\\nMyth: I can’t afford insurance.\\nTruth: Some insurance you can’t afford to be without.\\nOne day as I went to lunch, I met Steve and Sandy in my reception area.\\nThey came by to say thanks. What for? This young couple in their twenties\\nlistens to our radio program, and because I constantly push people to get the\\nright kinds of insurance, they did. This year they got term life insurance and a\\nMedical Saving Account health-insurance policy. “ Good thing we did what\\nyou said to do,” said Steve as he pulled off his cap to reveal a shaved head\\nwith a big scar across the top. “ What in the world happened?” I asked. The\\nscar was from a biopsy that revealed inoperable brain cancer. Sandy smiled\\nand said, “ The health insurance has already paid over $100,000 in bills, and\\nwe would be sunk if we hadn’t followed through as you push all the time.”\\nAlso, Steve was uninsurable, so he was thankful to have his term life\\ninsurance in place. Steve and Sandy became friends of mine over the next few\\n\\nyears as he fought cancer. A friend of mine heard their story and gave them a\\nseven-day Caribbean cruise. Steve lost his battle to cancer in 2005, and we\\nburied him on the day his son was born. He would be proud if his story\\ninspires you to get and keep the right kinds of insurance. He was a good\\nhusband and father. By being responsible and buying the right kinds of\\ninsurance, they had covered life and death, which we all have to do.\\nTwo years ago, my wife and I were just an average family making the typical financial\\nmistakes most “normal” families do. We believed all the money myths people kept telling\\nus. However, once our mistakes started adding up, they began to really take their toll on\\nus. It wasn’t until we stumbled upon Dave’s radio show and The Total Money Makeover\\nthat we put a stop to our financial foolishness.\\nYears ago, we were not handling our finances well at all. At one point we were married\\nwith no kids, making more than $80,000 a year, and we did not have the cash to buy a\\nwashing machine. We went along with too many “buy now, pay later” deals. “Ninety days\\nsame as cash” sounded like a good idea at the time. WRONG! We ended up paying much\\nmore than the items were worth. When we make purchases today, we “buy now, pay now,”\\nwith $1,800 buying $2,000 worth of furniture.\\nAnother big mistake we made was our life-insurance plan. People warned us that we\\nneeded to have whole life insurance before we turn thirty “or else.” They talked about how\\n\\namazing the cash value savings feature was. WRONG! We were ignorant about how\\noverpriced the coverage was, how high the fees were, and how long it really took to build\\ncash value. We now know better. We plan to save, invest, and become self-insured.\\nIn 2006, we were still making minimum payments on student loans that we had for more\\nthan a decade. We bought into what all the “normal” people were telling us: “Student\\nloans are good debt. Everyone has them.” WRONG! We knew we needed to kick Sallie\\nMae to the curb once and for all. Now, instead of writing her a check every month, we are\\nable to save in advance for our children’s college fund.\\nFast forward through the Financial Peace University Home-study Kit and fifteen\\nmonths of complete sacrifice—we’ve paid off $27,000 in debt, saved an emergency fund,\\ndumped the whole life insurance and purchased term life, created wills, and saved cash for\\na two-week “Freedom!” beach vacation to celebrate. After a lot of hard work and gazelle\\nintensity, we are finally living like no one else!\\nTravis (age 33) and\\nMerry (age 35) Skinner\\nAutoCAD Draftsman in land\\nsurveying; Registered Nurse\\nWe all hate insurance, until we need it. We pay and pay and pay\\npremiums, and sometimes we feel insurance-poor. There are certainly many\\ngimmicks in the world of insurance. We cover insurance in detail at Financial\\nPeace University and in other books, but you must have insurance in some\\nbasic categories as part of a Total Money Makeover:\\n• Auto and Homeowner Insurance—Choose higher deductibles in order to save on\\npremiums. With high liability limits, these are the best buys in the insurance world.\\n• Life Insurance—Purchase twenty-year level term insurance equal to about ten times\\nyour income. Term insurance is cheap and the only way to go; never use life\\ninsurance as a place to save money.\\n• Long-Term Disability—If you are thirty-two years old, you are twelve times more\\nlikely to become disabled than to die by age sixty-five. The best place to buy\\ndisability insurance is through work at a fraction of the cost. You can usually get\\ncoverage that equals from 50 to 70 percent of your income.\\n\\n• Health Insurance—The number-one cause of bankruptcy today is medical bills;\\nnumber two is credit cards. One way to control costs is to look for large deductibles to\\nlower your premium. The HSA (Health Savings Account) is a great way to save on\\npremiums. The high deductible creates a much lower premium, and this plan allows\\nyou to save for medical expenses in a tax-free savings account.\\n• Long-Term Care Insurance—If you are over sixty, buy Long-Term Care insurance to\\ncover in-home care or nursing home care. The average nursing home stay costs\\n$40,000 per year, which will crack and scramble a nest egg in a heartbeat. Dad in the\\nnursing home can use up Mom’s $250,000 savings in just a few short years. Make\\nyour parents get it.\\nIwas so impressed with Dave when I heard him for the first time on the The Oprah\\nWinfrey Show. I knew the personal responsibility and financial accountability he was\\nchallenging people with was exactly what Ken and I needed. Our financial problems had\\nbeen accumulating for twenty years and were pretty substantial.\\nIt all started the year after Ken and I were married. He was thirty-one and I was\\ntwenty-two—excited about life and the future ahead of us. But everything changed when\\nKen suffered a severe stroke and was left a quadriplegic. We didn’t know what to do (in\\nmany regards). Financially, we started putting everything on the credit card because we\\nweren’t bringing in much money. Thankfully Ken’s medical bills were covered. Without\\nthat coverage, the medical bills would have been too much to handle.\\n\\nFor years we racked up debt and were struggling to get by.Nevertheless, God truly\\nblessed us and continued to pull us through everything.\\nAnd then we found Dave. Ken and I read The Total Money Makeover and began to\\npractice the principles immediately. When we started budgeting, Ken really showed\\ninterest in helping me handle our finances and started paying the bills online. The first time\\nthat I didn’t have to pay the bills, I actually sat down and cried because it was one thing\\nthat I didn’t have to worry about. Ken lit up, knowing that he was an active partner, making\\nmy life a little easier. We have made budgeting and planning our future together enjoyable\\nand fun. It’s like dating again! Ken is the most amazing man I have ever met and has been\\nmy rock all these years. I am so blessed to be on this journey with him.\\nCheryl (age 44) and\\nKen (age 52) Rhoads\\nMary Kay Independent Sales\\nDirector\\nMyth: If I do a will, I might die.\\nTruth: You are going to die—so do it with a will.\\nEstate planners tell us that 70 percent of Americans die without a will.\\nDumb, really dumb. The state, known for its financial prowess, will decide\\nwhat happens to your stuff, your kids, and your financial legacy. The proverb\\nsays, “ A good man leaves an inheritance to his children’s children” (Prov.\\n13:22 NKJV). I am a pragmatist, and so I don’t understand all the fretting\\nover a will. A will is a gift you leave your family or loved ones. It is a gift\\nbecause it makes the management of your estate very clear and light-years\\neasier.\\nSHOCKING STATS\\n70% of Americans die without a will.\\n\\nYou are going to die, so go out in style, and die with a will in place.\\nWe’ve revealed Debt Myths and Money Myths. If you have carefully read\\nand understood why these myths are untrue, I have great news for you. Your\\nTotal Money Makeover has already begun! The Total Money Makeover is a\\nremaking of your view of money so that you permanently change how you\\ndeal with money. You must walk to the beat of a different drummer, the same\\nbeat that the wealthy hear. If the beat sounds common or normal, evacuate the\\ndance floor immediately. The goal is not to be normal because, as my radio\\nlisteners know by now, normal is broke.\\n\\n5\\nTwo More Hurdles:\\nIgnorance and Keeping Up with the Joneses\\n \\nDenial (I don’t have a problem), Debt Myths (debt is how you become\\nwealthy), and Money Myths (stories told by the culture) are three major\\nobstacles that keep you from becoming a fiscally fit body of money\\nmanagement and staying power. Before we move to the proven plan, we must\\nexplore two more enemies of your Total Money Makeover.\\n \\nIf you have a major issue with Ben and Jerry’s ice cream, you should tell\\nyour trainer before you try to change your diet and exercise program. First,\\nyou must admit your ice-cream problem and recognize the myths about ice\\ncream as a great weight-loss product. The point is, we must identify the\\nenemy, the hurdles to winning. To set out a game plan and not acknowledge\\nthe obstacles to that plan would be immature and unrealistic. Those of us who\\nhave been knocked around by life know that we must find the problems or\\nobstacles and plan a way over them, through them, or around them. If you can\\nbox up the things that would defeat your Total Money Makeover, then the\\nplan will work. The first step to losing weight and toning up is to identify\\nweight-loss myths, overeating, wrong eating, and no exercise as problems to\\novercome; the same is true for a Total Money Makeover. As the great\\nphilosopher Pogo from the Sunday comics said years ago, “ We have met the\\nenemy and he is us.”\\n“We have met the enemy and he is us.”\\n \\nHurdle #1: Ignorance: No One Is Born Financially Smart\\n \\nThe first hurdle is Ignorance. In a culture that worships knowledge, to say\\nignorance about money is an issue makes some people defensive. Don’t be\\n\\ndefensive. Ignorance is not lack of intelligence; it is lack of know-how. I have\\nseen many newborn babies of friends, relatives, church members, and team\\nmembers. I have never seen a baby who was born ready to be wealthy. Never\\ndo the friends and relatives gather around the window of the nursery and\\nexclaim, “ Oh, look! She is a born financial genius!”\\nNo one is born with the knowledge of how to drive a car. We are taught the\\nskill (although some of us don’t seem to have learned). No one is born with\\nthe knowledge of how to read and write; we are taught how. None of these are\\ninnate skills; all must be taught. Likewise, no one is born with the\\nknowledge of how to handle money, but we AREN’T taught that!\\nAt the coffeepot one day, one of my leaders said, “ We need to get this\\nTotal Money Makeover process taught in college.” Before she could graduate\\nfrom a small Christian college, she was required to take a class on how to\\ninterview and hunt for a job. She said the class wasn’t very hard academically,\\nbut its practical implications made it one of the most valuable classes she\\ntook in college. We go to school to learn to earn; we earn and then have no\\nidea what to do with the money. According to the Census Bureau, the average\\nfamily in America last year made $50,233. Even if they never get a raise, the\\naverage family will make over $2 million in a working lifetime! And we teach\\nNOTHING about how to manage this money in most high schools and\\ncolleges. We graduate from school, go out into the world, and get a financial\\nmaster’s degree in D.U.M.B.\\nIgnorance is not lack of intelligence; it is lack of know-how.\\nDo we make a mess of our finances because we aren’t intelligent? No. If\\nyou put someone who has never driven a car, has never seen a car, and can’t\\nspell car in the driver’s seat of a brand-new car, the wreck will come before\\nleaving the driveway. Backing up and gaining more speed only leads to\\nanother wreck. “ Trying harder” isn’t the answer because the next wreck will\\nnot only total the car but also hurt other people. This is ludicrous!\\n\\nDuring our lifetimes Americans average $2 million, yet we graduate from\\nhigh school, college, or even graduate school and can’t spell financial. This\\nis a bad plan! We have quit teaching personal finance, and we have to start\\nagain. That is why “ Foundations in Personal Finance” is taught in high\\nschools around the nation; however, our high-school curriculum won’t help\\nyou unless you are still in high school.\\nDave Rants ...\\nStupid things are always going to be done in families unless the wiser member learns to\\nstand up to the forceful one.\\nIf you made a mess of your money and/or haven’t gotten the best use from\\nit, usually the reason is that you were never taught to do so. Ignorance\\ndoesn’t mean dumb; it means you have to learn how. I’m fairly intelligent. I\\nhave had multiple best-selling books, speak to millions on my radio and TV\\nprograms, and run a multimillion-dollar company, but if you asked me to\\nwork on your car, I would make a mess. I don’t know how; I’m ignorant in\\nthat area.\\nOvercoming ignorance is easy. First, with no shame, admit that you are not\\na financial expert because you were never taught. Second, finish this book.\\nThird, go on a lifetime quest to learn more about money. You don’t need to\\napply to Harvard to get an MBA with a specialization in finance; you don’t\\nhave to watch the financial channel instead of a great movie. You do need to\\nread something about money at least once a year. You should occasionally\\nattend a seminar about money. Your actions should show that you care about\\nmoney by learning something about it.\\nSharon and I have a great marriage—not perfect, but great. Why? We read\\nabout marriage, we go to marriage retreat weekends, we date weekly, we\\nsometimes take a Sunday school class on marriage, and we even meet once in\\na while with a friend who is a Christian marriage counselor. Do we do all\\n\\nthese things because our marriage is weak? No, we do all these things to\\nmake our marriage great. We have a great marriage because we work at it,\\nmake it a priority, and seek knowledge on marriage. Great marriages don’t\\njust happen. Wealth doesn’t just happen. You will spend some time and effort\\non getting rid of ignorance. Again, you do not need to become a financial\\ngeek; you just need to spend more time on your 401k options and your\\nbudget than you do picking out this year’s vacation.\\nWe were going through life like, as Dave says, “Gomer Pyle on Valium.” We didn’t\\nhave a clue where our money was going. My wife and I couldn’t seem to agree on how to\\nmanage our incomes. Like all “normal” couples, we thought you HAD to have credit\\ncards to build up your credit and that the SMART thing to do was finance everything. What\\na huge lie!\\nThen one day my wife happened to catch The Dave Ramsey Show. After listening for a\\nwhile, she began to share with me the principles Dave talked about, and we were hooked!\\nThe first step in our Total Money Makeover was to get our budget together, which\\n\\ncertainly helped us to get organized with our money, but it was also our desire to live a\\ndebt-free lifestyle that allowed us to succeed. Next we had to work toward saving for an\\nEmergency Fund and paying off our debts using the Debt Snowball.\\nBaby Step Three, the fully funded emergency fund, was the hardest step for us. We had\\nto resist the urge to go spend all this available extra money after finishing our Debt\\nSnowball. Thankfully we built up our Emergency Fund, because later I lost my job. With no\\ndebt and an Emergency Fund in place, I was able to take my time to find the great job I\\nhave today.\\nOur family life has totally changed for the better. We know what our goals are for our\\nmoney, and our kids are learning to give, save, and spend money wisely.

Peer\\npressure, cultural expectations, “ reasonable standard of living”—I don’t care\\nhow you say it, we all need to be accepted by our crowd and our families.\\nThis need for approval and respect drives us to do some really insane things.\\nOne of the paradoxically dumb things we do is to destroy our finances by\\nbuying garbage we can’t afford to try to make ourselves appear wealthy to\\n\\nothers. Dr. Tom Stanley wrote a wonderful book in the ’90s that you should\\nread entitled The Millionaire Next Door. His book is a study of America’s\\nmillionaires. Remember, if you want to be thin and muscular, you should\\nstudy the habits of people who are thin and muscular. If you want to be rich,\\nyou should study the habits and value systems of the rich. In his study of\\nmillionaires, Stanley discovered that their habits and value systems were not\\nwhat most people think. When we think of millionaires, we think of big\\nhouses, new cars, and really nice clothes. Stanley found that most millionaires\\ndon’t have those things. He found the typical millionaire lives in a middle-\\nclass home, drives a two-year-old or older paid-for car, and buys blue jeans at\\nWal-Mart. In short, Stanley found that the typical millionaire found infinitely\\nmore motivation from the goal of financial security than from what friends and\\nfamily thought. The need for approval and respect from others based on what\\nthey owned was virtually nonexistent.\\nDum Math & Stupid Tax\\nGet a Head Start on Big-Time Debt\\nThe average college student pays $5,000 more per year to live and eat off-campus than\\nto live in the dorm and eat cafeteria food. Student loans were needed not to earn their\\ndegree but only to look good while getting it.\\nIf we look at Stanley’s findings and hold those up against Ken and Barbie’s\\nlife plan, we find Ken and Barbie to be lost, off course, and clueless. Ken and\\nBarbie are in our office all the time for financial counseling. Last year they\\nwere here, and their names were Bob and Sara. Bob and Sara make $93,000\\nper year and have for the last seven years. What do they have to show for it?\\nA $400,000 home that they still owe $390,000 on, including a home equity\\nloan used to furnish it. They have two $30,000 fleeced cars and $52,000 in\\ncredit-card debt, but they have traveled well and dressed in high fashion. The\\n$25,000 left on a student loan from college ten years ago is still outstanding\\n\\nbecause they have no money. On the positive side, they have $2,000 in\\nsavings and $18,000 in their 401k. These people have a negative net worth,\\nbut they really look good. Bob’s mom is very impressed, and Sara’s brother\\nfrequently stops by to ask for money because they are “ obviously doing well.”\\nThey present the perfect picture of the American dream that has turned into a\\nnightmare. Behind the perfect hair and the French manicure, there was deep\\ndesperation, a sense of futility, an unraveling marriage, and disgust with\\nthemselves.\\nDon’t even consider keeping up with the Joneses. THEY’RE BROKE!\\nThis may be one of the places our metaphor of weight loss for fiscal fitness\\nbreaks down. If your body were in the same condition that Bob and Sara’s\\nmoney is in, everyone would think, Five hundred pounds is just too fat.\\nYour problem would be apparent to family, friends, strangers, and even you.\\nThe difference with Bob and Sara is that they have a “ dirty little secret.” The\\nsecret is that they are nowhere near as cool as they appear. They are broke and\\ndesperate, and no one knows it. Not only does no one know it, but everyone\\nthinks the opposite is true. So when my counselor made suggestions to turn\\naround this bankruptcy looking for a place to happen, there was more than one\\nplace of resistance in the heart. The truth is that Bob and Sara are broke. They\\nneed to get rid of the cars and sell the house.\\nResistance of the heart is real. First, of course, we like our nice houses and\\nnice cars, and selling them would be painful. Second, we don’t want to admit\\nto everyone we have impressed that we are fakes. Yes, when you buy a big\\npile of stuff with no money and lots of debt, you are a financial fake. Peer\\npressure is very, very powerful. “ We are scaling down” is a painful statement\\nto make to friends or family. “ We will have to pass on that trip or dinner\\nbecause it is not in our budget” is virtually impossible for some people to\\nsay. Being real takes tremendous courage. We like approval, and we like\\nrespect, and to say otherwise is another form of denial. To wish for the\\nadmiration of others is normal. The problem is that this admiration can\\nbecome a drug. Many of you are addicted to this drug, and the destruction to\\nyour wealth and financial well-being caused by your addiction is huge.\\n\\nRadical change . . . is required for a money breakthrough.\\nRadical change in the quest for approval, which has involved purchasing\\nstuff with money we don’t have, is required for a money breakthrough. Sara’s\\nbreakthrough came with family. Her family was upper-middle-crust and had\\nalways given Christmas gifts to every member. With twenty nieces and\\nnephews and six sets of adults to buy for, just on her side, the budget was\\nridiculous. Sara’s announcement at Thanksgiving that this year Christmas\\ngiving was going to be done with the drawing of names, because she and Bob\\ncouldn’t afford it, was earth-shattering. Some of you are grinning as if this is\\nno big deal. It was a huge deal in Sara’s family! Gift giving was a tradition!\\nHer mother and two of her sisters-in-law were furious. Very little thanks were\\ngiven that Thanksgiving, but Sara stood her ground and said, “ No more.”\\nSara has a master’s degree in sociology, so she is no pushover. She\\nunderstood how the family dynamic would be upset, and she understood that\\nshe would lose approval, admiration, and respect. Sara said later that while\\nshe grasped intellectually what her announcement meant, and she knew\\nemotionally and financially that this was the correct thing to do, the reality\\nwas very hard. Strong peer pressure from her family literally kept her awake\\nthe whole night before. She told me, “ As I lay in the dark, I was afraid, like a\\nlittle twelve-year-old girl yearning for approval from her daddy.” The courage\\nto address what may seem like a small issue was a huge breakthrough for\\nSara. That Thanksgiving her heart had a Total Money Makeover, and she was\\nnot going to be led into well-dressed poverty by peer pressure anymore.\\n\\nOur financial makeover began in March 2008, when we bought a copy of The Total\\nMoney Makeover while on vacation. I read the foreword aloud to my husband as we drove\\nhome, and he asked me to continue reading. Four hours later, my voice was hoarse and\\ntired, but we were still reading as the family minivan pulled into the driveway!We were\\nhooked and energized. It felt like our whole world had just been lit up!\\nThat same night, we pulled out all of our bills and made a list of everything we owed.\\nThen, we made a budget. It took hours, but afterward we were ready to attack our debt!\\nWe set a goal to pay everything off in time to celebrate some major milestones that were\\nless than a year away: our fifteenth wedding anniversary and Darrin’s fortieth birthday. At\\nthe time, it seemed impossible!\\nWe’ve always had car payments and credit card payments—there’s never been a time\\nwhen we were debt-free. We avoided discussing money because it would always end with\\nan argument or someone’s feelings getting hurt. We simply pretended our personal\\nfinances didn’t exist.\\nBut with our new plan in place, we went crazy and never looked back. We cut up our\\ncredit cards one by one as we paid them off.More important, we got on the same page with\\nour money, which is something we never thought possible!\\n\\nIn 10 months we paid off $58,000 of debt and put $18,000 toward our fully funded\\nemergency fund! We’re teaching our three boys how to save their money and make smart\\ndecisions with it. They’ve learned about the dangers of credit cards and how to compare\\nprices on things they want.\\nNot only are we confident about our financial future today, but we are more excited\\nabout it than any other time in our lives. Words can’t describe the burden that has been\\nlifted from our hearts and minds! We’ve really had a Total Money Makeover!\\nDarrin (age 40) and Kristin\\n(age 39) Schmidt\\nAccountant; stay-at-home mom\\nEveryone has a weak spot like Sara’s. It could be your third-generation\\nfailing business that needs to be closed. It could be your clothes shopping. It\\nprobably is your car. It could be the boat. Maybe yours is giving to your\\ngrown children. Unless you have had a heart-level Total Money Makeover\\nsomewhere, sometime in your life, you are still doing something with money\\nto impress others, and that has to change before you can get on a real plan to\\nfiscal fitness. The Bible states, “ Godliness with contentment is great gain” (1\\nTim. 6:6 NKJV). Those of us who have had a Total Money Makeover still\\nknow where our Achilles’ heel is and still see that weak spot as a fatal wound\\nif we allow it to grow again. What is the one “ money thing” that makes you\\ngrin inside when you see others admiring it? Do you need to give it up to\\nbreak that feeling inside you? Until you recognize that weak area, you will\\nalways be prone to financial stupidity on that subject.\\nMy weak spot is cars. After starting with nothing and becoming a\\nmillionaire the first time by age twenty-six, I had the eye of my heart set on a\\nJaguar. I “ needed” a Jaguar. What I needed was for people to be impressed\\nwith my success. What I needed was family raising an eyebrow of approval\\nbased on my ability to win. What I yearned for was respect. What I was so\\nshallow to believe was that the car I drove gave me those things. God used\\nthe whole story of what I drove to give my heart a Total Money Makeover in\\nthe area of peer pressure.\\n\\nTotally Broke and Driving a Jag!\\nAs I was going broke, losing everything, I kept the Jaguar by refinancing it\\nrepeatedly at different, friendlier banks. I even went so far as to get a good\\nfriend to cosign a loan so I could keep this image car. I couldn’t afford to keep\\nup the maintenance on the car, so it began to deteriorate. It ran poorly and\\nwasn’t reliable, but I still loved it and hung on. Within the year of our\\nbankruptcy, we were so broke that our electricity was once cut off for two\\ndays. I have often wondered what the guy from the electric company thought\\nas he stood in the driveway next to my Jaguar and pulled my electric meter.\\nThat is sick. The car continued to deteriorate, and the main seal on the oil\\npan cracked. This caused oil coming out the back of the engine onto the\\nmuffler to burn. The burning oil, lots of it, created a smoke screen for miles\\nbehind me everywhere I went. The bid to fix it was $1,700, and I hadn’t seen\\nan extra $1,700 in months, so I just kept driving my James Bond smoke-\\nscreen mobile. Finally, my friend got really tired of making the payments he\\nhad cosigned for and gently suggested I sell my precious car. I was mad at\\nhim. How dare he suggest that I sell my car! So he quit making the\\npayments, and the bank not so gently suggested I sell the car or they would\\nrepo it. I tried to stall and only came to my senses and sold the Jaguar on a\\nThursday morning because the bank assured me they would take it on Friday.\\nI was able to work my way through the mess, pay the bank and even my\\nfriend back, but the process was humiliating. Because I was too stubborn to\\naddress what that car represented in my life, I caused much damage that was\\navoidable.\\nMyths vs.Truth\\nMyth: Car payments are a way of life; you’ll always have one.\\nTruth: Staying away from car payments by driving reliable used cars is what the\\naverage millionaire does; that is how he or she became a millionaire.\\n\\nAn interesting footnote about how healing can occur on your weak spot: I\\nwas so disgusted with myself when I woke up and realized the depth of my\\nstupidity that I swore off my drug, cars. I went to abstinence, meaning I\\ndidn’t care what we drove or what it looked like as long as we were winning\\nin our Total Money Makeover. Fast-forward fifteen years. We had become\\nwealthy again, and I decided to get a different car. I’m always looking for a\\none- or two-year-old car, I’m always paying cash, and I’m always looking for\\na deal, not really caring what car it is. I was kind of looking for a Mercedes or\\na Lexus, but I was really looking for a steal. A friend in the car business called\\nme with a deal—on a Jaguar. So all those years and tears later, when it was\\nno longer the driving force of my approval rating, God allowed a Jaguar back\\ninto my life. He returned what the locusts had eaten, but He only did so when\\nit was not my idol. Rumor has it that God doesn’t like us to have other gods\\nin our lives.\\nLooking back, we were your typical American family: making good money, having lots of\\nnice toys, and drowning in debt. We always told ourselves we deserved new cars and we\\nneeded a house so we could stop paying rent.\\n\\nA friend at work was talking about Dave Ramsey one day, and it intrigued me so I got\\nhis book, The Total Money Makeover, and we started reading. We got motivated because\\nwe heard the stories of people making much less than us but who were debt-free—a place\\nwe wanted to be.\\nEstablishing a budget was priority, but first we had to overcome the mind-set that we\\n“needed” stuff to make us happy. We were able to pay off our debt without having to give\\nup too much; instead we redirected what we already had.\\nThe change has been amazing. My wife no longer feels guilty for spending money on\\nmuch-needed clothes. I can relax when it comes to paying bills at the end of the month,\\nknowing there’s still money in the checking account. It’s all worth it.\\nWe now talk about our finances instead of just fighting about money. We have been able\\nto save for retirement and know that if anything happens to one of us, the other is taken\\ncare of and will not be burdened with debt.\\nMy wife and I have been debt-free since January of 2004, and life is so much easier\\nnow.\\nBrian (age 36) and\\nTammy (age 33) McKinley\\nPurchasing Agent for physician-\\nmanagement organization;\\nAgricultural Economist\\nSo maybe someday Sara and Bob will be able to pay cash to take Sara’s\\nwhole family on a cruise for Christmas. After their Total Money Makeover,\\nBob and Sara will be able to pay cash for a huge event like that and not even\\ndent their wealth. They will be able to buy that cruise in memory of that\\nfateful Thanksgiving when Sara’s heart had a Total Money Makeover in her\\nneed for her family’s approval. That change has taught Sara and Bob that if\\nthey will live like no one else, later they will be able to live like no one else.\\nPast the Obstacle Course and Up the Mountain\\nOne thing I have learned as I have lost fat, become toned, and generally gotten\\n\\ninto better shape is this: things that require physical output are easier for me.\\nThings like mountain climbing or obstacle courses are actually doable now,\\nnot a dream as they were when I was overweight and out of shape. The same\\nis true of our Total Money Makeover journey to fiscal fitness. Have you\\nrealized by now that the start of your Total Money Makeover is almost an\\nobstacle course? We busted through denial. We waded through and climbed\\nover Debt Myths. We carefully scaled the wall of Money Myths. We are\\nworking through Ignorance. And we have learned not to place so much\\nemphasis on our competition on the course; we have permanently quit\\nkeeping up with the Joneses, because the Joneses are broke. The obstacle\\ncourse, however, was only part of our journey.\\nSHOCKING STATS\\n90% of airline miles “rewarded” are never redeemed.\\nNow we stand at the bottom of a mountain with a clear view of the top. We\\nare in better shape now for mountain climbing, and there are no blind spots.\\nWe are ready to climb. The goal is far off, but we can see it clearly now.\\nThere is a distinct and very clear path we will take to the top. The good thing\\nabout this path is that it is not virgin territory; it is a well-worn path. It is a\\nnarrow path, one that most people don’t follow, but many winners have. Tens\\nof thousands have followed this path once they made it through the obstacle\\ncourse.\\nTake a look back before we start. The climb will be hard, but it will be\\nnear impossible if you are still struggling with any of the obstacles, if you are\\nstill hanging on to Myths, Denial, or any other obstacles. On this mountain\\nclimb you will feel as if you have bricks in your backpack. A couple of\\npounds of denial might not be fatal, but mixing it with three pounds of “ I\\nstill think credit cards are good” and a can or two of “ folding to peer pressure”\\nwill result in a backpack load that will ensure your climb is a failure. Most of\\n\\nus make the first climb wearing a hat of Ignorance, and while it will slow the\\nclimb, ignorance will not keep anyone from the top when mixed with some\\nhumility. This mountain is doable, but not if you are still bogged down on\\nthe obstacle course. Some things I’ll tell you to do won’t work and will\\ncause damage if you still cling to Denial, Myths, Ignorance, or Approval.\\nDecide before the climb if you are going to follow the guide. If you aren’t\\ngoing to listen to the seasoned guide who has personally made this climb\\nalone and then returned to lead tens of thousands up this path, then you climb\\nat your own peril. Finish reading the book even if you don’t agree with me,\\nbut following these steps while trying to hold on to Myths, Ignorance,\\nApproval, or Denial will make your climb very hard and may injure you.\\n“Continuing to do the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result is\\nthe definition of insanity.”\\nWhy not climb? The only other path is to follow all the normal people\\nwho are broke. That isn’t a path; it is a well-beaten interstate highway. Most\\npeople drive around and around, occasionally glancing forlornly at the\\nmountain we will climb, but when they see how tough the obstacle course is\\njust to get to the bottom, those sad souls quit before they ever begin.\\nThe Twelve Steppers have it right. They say, “ Continuing to do the same\\nthing over and over again and expecting a different result is the definition of\\ninsanity.” What you have falsely believed and acted on or not acted on has\\nbrought you to the place you are today with your money. If you want to be in\\na different place, you must believe and do things differently. If I want a smaller\\nwaist size than fifty-two inches, I must eat and exercise differently. The change\\nwill be painful, but the result will be worth it.\\nI’ve been to the top of Total Money Makeover Mountain, and I’ve led\\ncountless others there. I say, IT IS WORTH THE EFFORT! So lace up your\\nshoes of resolve, wave good-bye to your “ normal” friends, and let’s climb!\\n\\n6 \\nSave $1,000 Fast: \\nWalk Before You Run\\n \\nIn my first book, Financial Peace, there is a chapter entitled “ Baby Steps,”\\nthe premise of which is that we can do anything financially if we do it one\\nlittle step at a time. I have developed the Baby Steps over years of counseling\\none-on-one, in small-group discussions, with real-world lives in Financial\\nPeace University, and by answering questions on our radio show. Tens of\\nthousands have followed this tried-and-true system to achieve their Total\\nMoney Makeover. The term baby steps comes from the comedy What About\\nBob? starring Bill Murray. Bill plays a crazy guy who drives his psychiatrist\\ncrazy. The therapist has written a book called Baby Steps. The statement\\n“ You can get anywhere if you simply go one step at a time” is the framework\\nfor the movie. We will use the Baby Steps to walk through our Total Money\\nMakeover. Why do the Baby Steps work? I thought you would never ask.\\n \\n“You can get anywhere if you simply go one step at a time.”\\n \\nEating an Elephant Gives You Energy\\n \\nThe way you eat an elephant is one bite at a time. Find something to do and\\ndo that with vigor until it is complete; then and only then do you move to\\nthe next step. If you try to do everything at once, you will fail. If you woke up\\nthis morning and realized you needed to lose 100 pounds, build your\\ncardiovascular system, and tone your muscles, what would you do? If on the\\nfirst day of your new plan you quit eating, run three miles, and lift all the\\nweight you can lift with every muscle group, you will collapse. If you don’t\\ncollapse the first day, wait forty-eight hours for the muscle groups to lock up\\nand the cardio to go crazy, and you will be bingeing on food shortly thereafter.\\nWhen I went on a quest for a better body and better health a few years ago, my\\n\\nwise trainer didn’t try to kill me the first day. Not even by the second week\\nwere we pushing the envelope, because he knew I had to create some muscle\\ntone before we could hit hard workouts. We walked before we ran. Plus, if I\\nhad tried to do everything at once, I would have been overwhelmed and\\nfrustrated with my inability to do it all.\\nThe power of focus is what causes our Baby Steps to work. When you try\\nto do everything at once, progress can be very slow. When you put 3 percent\\nin your 401k, $50 extra on the house payment, and $5 extra on the credit\\ncard, you dilute your efforts. Because you attack several areas at once, you\\ndon’t finish anything you start for a long time. That makes you feel that you\\naren’t accomplishing anything, which is very dangerous. If you feel that\\nnothing is getting done, you will soon lose energy for the task of money\\nmanagement altogether. The power of focus is that it works. Things happen.\\nYou check stuff off your list. Life gives you an “ attaboy” in the form of actual\\nvisible progress.\\nThe power of priority also causes the Baby Steps to work. Each of these\\nsteps is part of the proven plan to financial fitness I promised you. They build\\non one another; therefore, if done out of order, they do not work. Think of a\\n350-pound person beginning marathon training with a quick ten-mile run.\\nThe results of not building up to that run could be total frustration at best and\\na heart attack at worst. So do the Baby Steps in order. Walk around the block\\nand lose some weight before going on a ten-mile run.\\nTo start the Baby Steps, we will work on one important step to the\\nexclusion of others. Patience! We will climb the whole mountain, but not\\nuntil we first have a strong base camp. You will be tempted to short-circuit\\nthe process because you are more concerned about one certain area of your\\nmoney, but don’t do it. These steps are the proven plan to financial fitness,\\nand they are in the right order for everyone. For example, if you are fifty-five\\nwith no retirement, you may be tempted to jump to Step Four (Invest 15\\nPercent of Your Income in Retirement), because you are scared about not\\nbeing able to retire with dignity. The paradox is that by shortcutting the\\n\\nprocess, you are much more likely to fail at retiring with dignity. Failure\\ncould also occur when you cash out your newly formed retirement plan to\\ncover the inevitable emergency. If you have kids heading toward college, you\\nmay be panicking about saving for college, which is covered in Baby Step\\nFive, but don’t do it out of order. I will address the problems you’ll run into\\nat each stage if you get things out of order, because I have seen most of them.\\nFocus exclusively on the Baby Step you are on, even though it seems to be a\\ntemporary detriment to other areas of money. Things will be fine if you don’t\\nfocus on retirement for a few months, as long as you can kick retirement into\\nthe stratosphere when we get there.\\nYOU, Inc.\\nThis chapter is about the first Baby Step, but before we discuss saving $1,000\\nfast, we need to look at some basic tools needed to win and some ongoing\\nthings you should be doing as you go. The dreaded B word enters the picture\\nhere. You must set up a budget, a written budget, every month. This is a\\nbook about a process that will enable you to win with your money, a process\\nthat others have completed successfully, and I assure you that virtually none of\\nthe thousands of winners I have seen did so without a written budget.\\n\\nWe were so motivated to start our Total Money Makeover when we finally realized that\\nwhat we were doing wasn’t working. Every month there was more month than money, and\\nall we would do is fight about it. We were sick and tired of being sick and tired!\\nBudgeting was the best and the hardest part of the whole process.We needed to make\\nsure we had our money going toward certain debts while cutting back on WANTS. It takes\\nsome effort every week and, for sure, discipline, and if we were good at either, we would\\nhave never been in this mess.\\nOur biggest sacrifice has been having to wait. We wait on a lot of things now until we\\nactually have the money. What a great idea!Christmas will be different this year. I think it\\nwill be a lot better because everything under the tree will be paid for, and we’ll actually\\nenjoy it instead of regret it.\\nThe change is evident in so many areas of our life. We feel comfortable knowing that we\\nwill be able to save for our children’s college and we’re able to tithe consistently. And the\\nfunny thing is that we don’t miss the money.\\nLiving debt-free has been amazing. My wife and I communicate better, and we’re more\\nloving to each other and the kids because we aren’t stressed out about money all of the\\ntime.\\n\\nTony (age 36) and \\nTara (age 37) Kiger \\nSmall-business Owner; \\nHomemaker\\nIn Chapter 4 on Money Myths, the importance of a written budget was\\ndiscussed. If you worked for a company called YOU, Inc., and your job at\\nYOU, Inc., was to manage money—and you managed money at YOU, Inc.,\\nthe way you manage your own money now, would YOU, Inc., fire you? You\\nhave to tell money what to do or it leaves. A written budget for the month is\\nyour money goal. People who win at anything have written goals. Goals are\\nwhat you are aiming at. Zig Ziglar says, “ If you aim at nothing, you will hit\\nit every time.” Money won’t behave unless you tame it. P. T. Barnum said,\\n“ Money is an excellent slave and a horrible master.” You wouldn’t build a\\nhouse without a blueprint, so why do you spend your lifetime income of over\\n$2 million without a blueprint? Jesus said, “ Which of you, intending to\\nbuild a tower, does not sit down first and count the cost, whether he has\\nenough to finish it . . .” (Luke 14:28 NKJV).\\nYou have to tell money what to do or it leaves.\\n\\nThere never seemed to be enough “bucks” to cover all our family’s expenses. I was\\npanicked each month because we were barely squeaking by: paying our bills, funding\\nextracurricular activities for our kids, paying for car repairs, etc. John was frustrated\\nbecause his check was gone before he walked in the door. There was too little to go\\naround, and we had huge differences in opinion regarding what to pay first. Thanks to a\\nfriend, I ended up reading The Total Money Makeover and realized our family’s\\nfinancially peaceful future was just around the corner if we could get everyone onboard.\\nSure enough, after John read Dave’s book, he came to the same conclusions I had. We\\nwere so excited to be on the same page financially and start using our money wisely! We\\nestablished a budget and got rid of our credit cards. We knew we had to work together to\\naccomplish our goal, so we’ve spent a lot of time communicating with one another\\nconcerning how our spending can really enhance the lives of our family. A lot of couples\\nforfeit working together on their budgets, and one always ends up pushing and nagging the\\nother. It is so important to work with each other from the very beginning! It might seem\\nboring, but we’ve turned our regular budget/calendar meetings into enjoyable, future-\\nplanning dates!\\nIt’s so nice not to have anxiety about money. We have been able to do so much more\\nwith our four kids and truly enjoy those special times with them. Also, we’re making plans\\nto add a second floor to our house. Before starting Dave’s plan, I had a hard time\\ndreaming with John about it because I thought it would never happen. Now I can see that\\nsecond floor in our near future. Making a plan and sticking to it has made all the difference\\nfor the entire family. I can’t imagine living without a budget! The financial rewards are\\nwonderful, but the peace of mind it has given John and me is even greater.\\nSarada (age 34) and \\nJohn (age 37) Marsh \\nHomemaker; Civil Engineer\\nBrian Tracy, motivational speaker, says, “ What does it take to succeed on\\na big scale? A tremendous God-given talent? Inherited wealth? A decade of\\npostgraduate education? Connections? Fortunately for most of us, what it\\ntakes is something very simple and accessible: clear, written goals.”\\nAccording to Brian Tracy, a study of Harvard graduates found that after two\\nyears, the 3 percent who had written goals achieved more financially than the\\nother 97 percent combined!\\nThis is not a textbook on money; this is a book on the steps to take and\\nhow to take them. This isn’t a chapter on budgeting; however, many of our\\n\\nbudget forms from the Financial Peace software program are in the back of this\\nbook for you to use. The instructions are on each page, but let me give you a\\ncouple of guidelines to get started on budgeting.\\nSet up a new budget every month. Don’t try to have the perfect budget for\\nthe perfect month, because we never have those. Spend every dollar on paper\\nbefore the month begins. Give every dollar of your income a name before the\\nmonth begins, which is called a zero-based budget. Income minus outgo\\nequals zero every month. Look at this month’s income and this month’s\\nbills, savings, and debts, and match them up until you have given every\\nincome dollar an outgo name. If you have an irregular income due to\\ncommissions, self-employment, or bonuses, use the Irregular-Income Planning\\nsheet in the system to create a prioritized spending plan, but you still must do\\na written budget before each month begins.\\nIncome minus outgo equals zero every month.\\nThe financial mentality I grew up with said, “If you want anything out of life, you’re going\\n\\nto have to get into debt for it!” And so I did. By the time I was in my mid-twenties, I had\\naccumulated $3,000 in debt on a mobile home, $9,000 in debt on a car, approximately\\n$1,000 on credit cards, and $50,000 on a newly purchased home. That’s a lot of debt to\\npay off on a salary of around $30,000 a year.\\nIt wasn’t until my cousin and her husband introduced me to Dave that I began to make\\nthe change in how I handled my money. They had attended Financial Peace University at\\na local church and decided to share the CDs with me. A few hours into the CDs, the light\\ncame on. I knew that I had to get a hold of my finances and start living life differently. I\\npurchased Financial Peace and The Total Money Makeover and began listening online to\\nDave every weekday.\\nMy most important move in becoming financially free: budgeting. I nearly passed out\\nwhen I realized how much I was spending on eating out! It took a few months to organize\\nmy funds and expenses, but now I’ve become a great budgeter! I give 10 percent of every\\npaycheck, and I’m currently allotting 49 percent of my salary to paying off my house. But\\nthanks to careful budgeting and spending, I’ll be able to assign 52 percent of my paycheck\\nto the house at the turn of the year! Then I will be able to give more and help others find\\nthe peace that I have found.\\nJaime Morgan (age 27) \\nAgriculture Communications\\nAgree on It\\nIf you’re married, agree on the budget with your spouse. This one sentence\\nrequires a stand-alone book to describe how, but the bottom line is this: if\\nyou aren’t working together, it is almost impossible to win. Once the budget\\nis agreed on and is in writing, pinky-swear and spit-shake that you will never\\ndo anything with money that is not on that paper. The paper is the boss of the\\nmoney, and you are the boss of what goes on the paper, but you have to stick\\nto the budget, or it’s just an elaborate theory.\\nIf something comes up in the middle of the month that causes the budget to\\nneed changing, call an emergency budget committee meeting. You can change\\nthe budget (and what you do with money) only if you do two things. One,\\nboth spouses agree to the change. Two, you must still balance your budget. If\\n\\nyou increase what you are spending on car repairs by $50, you must lower\\nwhat you are spending somewhere else by $50 so that your income minus\\nyour outgo still equals zero. This process of midcourse adjustment doesn’t\\nhave to be a big hairy deal, but both guidelines must be met. You still zero\\nout so you don’t blow the budget, and you get spousal approval so you\\nhaven’t broken the spit pact.\\nAdriennnne!\\nBefore we get to Baby Step One, you will have to do one other thing. You\\nwill have to be current with all your creditors. If you are behind on payments,\\nthe first goal will be to become current. If you are far behind, do necessities\\nfirst, which are basic food, shelter, utilities, clothing, and transportation. Only\\nwhen you’re current with the necessities can you catch up on credit cards and\\nstudent loans. If you need more help with this level of financial crisis, check\\nour Web site for how to contact one of our counselors or order the book\\nFinancial Peace.\\nDum Math & Stupid Tax\\nIt’s a Life-and-Life Situation\\nLooking to spend $100 per month on life insurance? You could pay $7 a month toward\\nterm insurance and invest the remaining $93. But go with a cash-value policy if you’d\\nrather have someone else earn interest on your investments.\\nFocused intensity is required to win. I can’t stress enough that people who\\nhave had a Total Money Makeover, those noted in this book and others across\\nAmerica, got mad. They got sick and tired of being sick and tired! They said,\\n“ We’ve had it!” and went ballistic to change their lives. There is no\\nintellectual exercise where you can academically work your way into wealth;\\n\\nyou have to get fired up. Play the music from Rocky in the background and\\nlisten for Rocky’s cry; “ Adriennnne!” Go get ’em, champ! There is no energy\\nin logic; this is behavior and motivation modification, and it works!\\nAfter you are current, have a written, agreed-on plan, have the obstacle\\ncourse behind you, and are focused and intense, you are ready to follow the\\nright priorities. Here we go.\\nBaby Step One: \\nSave $1,000 Cash as a Starter Emergency Fund\\nIt is going to rain. You need a rainy-day fund. You need an umbrella. Money\\nmagazine says that 78 percent of us will have a major negative event in a\\ngiven ten-year period of time. The job is downsized, right-sized, reorganized,\\nor you just plain get fired. There’s an unexpected pregnancy: “ We weren’t\\ngoing to have kids yet/another one.” Car blows up. Transmission goes out.\\nYou bury a loved one. Grown kids move home again. Life happens, so be\\nready. This is not a surprise. You need an emergency fund, an old-fashioned\\nGrandma’s rainy-day fund. Sometimes people tell me I should be more\\npositive. Well, I am positive; it is going to rain, so you need a rainy-day\\nfund. Now, obviously, $1,000 isn’t going to catch all these big things, but it\\nwill catch the little ones until the emergency fund is fully funded.\\nThey got sick and tired of being sick and tired! They said, “We’ve had it!”\\n\\nWe don’t have and never will have credit cards ever again. “Why?” you might ask (at\\nleast a lot of our family and friends do). Because we have found security and trust in God\\nfor the provision of all our needs, and we have gained the strength to build up an\\nemergency fund that can handle sudden expenses we weren’t expecting. Most people use\\nthe excuse that you should have at least one credit card for emergencies. We have found a\\nmuch better strategy. Plan ahead and build an emergency fund that can cover (with cash)\\nwhatever might come up.\\nWe have learned that getting a hold on your attitude is the number-one factor in being\\nvictorious over your finances. We now tell the money where to go instead of it guiding us\\naround and making us slaves to others (such as student loans and credit-card companies).\\nIn gaining a newfound respect and understanding of what we have been given, we have\\ncome to acknowledge and take responsibility for the money God has blessed us with. We\\nhad to face our debt and our desires and become better stewards of our possessions and\\nincome. Before, we didn’t realize that every little dollar adds up. The choice we had to\\nmake was whether we wanted those growing dollars in our savings account or on our\\ncredit-card statements.\\nSaving that initial $1,000 is so important to the rest of your Total Money Makeover. It\\nteaches you how to prepare for your unknown future and trust that when things do come\\nup, you’ll be able to handle them. It was so much easier to attack our debt and get rid of\\nour credit cards knowing that we had some money in the bank to cover our backs if\\nsomething came up. We don’t have to have a false sense of security in our credit cards\\nanymore. We’ve been good stewards and have real security because of our habits and\\n\\nperseverance. Sacrifice has had its place in our budgeting wants and desires, but it is\\ncompletely worth it. We remind ourselves that delaying a purchase doesn’t mean we will\\nnever have it. Trusting God, timing, patience, and preparation are everything, though,\\nwhen it comes to gaining financial peace.\\nStacie (age 35) and \\nAndré (age 36) Bledsoe \\nData Analyst; \\nProduction Technician\\nThis emergency fund is not for buying things or for vacation; it is for\\nemergencies only. No cheating. Do you know who Murphy is? Murphy is\\nthat guy with all those negative laws, such as, “ If it can go wrong, it will.”\\nFor years I have worked with people who felt that Murphy was a member of\\ntheir families. They have spent so much time with trouble that they think\\ntrouble is a first cousin. Interestingly enough, when we have had a Total\\nMoney Makeover, Murphy leaves. A Total Money Makeover is no guarantee\\nof a trouble-free life, but my observation has been that trouble, Murphy, is not\\nas welcome in homes that have an emergency fund. Saving money for\\nemergencies is Murphy-repellent! Being broke all the time seems to attract ol’\\nMurphy to set up residence.\\nMost of America uses credit cards to catch all of life’s “ emergencies.” Some\\nof these so-called emergencies are events like Christmas. Christmas is not an\\nemergency; it doesn’t sneak up on you. Christmas is always in December,\\nthey don’t move it; therefore it is not an emergency. Your car will need\\nrepairs, and your kids will outgrow their clothes. These are not emergencies;\\nthey are items that belong in your budget. If you don’t budget for them, they\\nwill feel like emergencies. Americans use the credit cards to cover actual\\nemergencies too. Things discussed earlier, like job layoffs, are real\\nemergencies and are the reason for an emergency fund. A leather couch on sale\\nis not an emergency.\\nChristmas is not an emergency.\\nWhether the emergency is real or just poor planning, the cycle of\\ndependence on credit cards has to be broken. A well-planned budget for\\n\\nanticipated things and an emergency fund for the truly unexpected can end\\ndependence on credit cards.\\nThe first major Baby Step to your Total Money Makeover is to begin the\\nemergency fund. A small start is to save $1,000 in cash fast! If you have a\\nhousehold income under $20,000 per year, use $500 for your beginner fund.\\nThose who earn more than $20,000 should get together $1,000 fast! Stop\\neverything and focus.\\nSince I hate debt so much, people often ask why we don’t start with the\\ndebt. I used to do that when I first started teaching and counseling, but I\\ndiscovered that people would stop their whole Total Money Makeover\\nbecause of an emergency—they felt guilty that they had to stop debt-reducing\\nto survive. It’s like stopping your whole fitness program because you get a\\nsore knee from a fall when running; you’ll find any excuse will do. The\\nalternator on the car would go out, and that $300 repair ruined the whole plan\\nbecause the purchase had to go on a credit card since there was no emergency\\nfund. If you use debt after swearing off it, you lose the momentum to keep\\ngoing. It is like eating seven pounds of ice cream on Friday after losing two\\npounds that week. You feel sick, like a failure.\\nSo start with a little fund to catch the little things before beginning to\\ndump the debt. It is like drinking a light protein shake to fortify your body so\\nyou can work out, which enables you to lose weight. The beginner fund will\\nkeep life’s little Murphies from turning into new debt while you work off the\\nold debt. If a real emergency happens, you have to handle it with your\\nemergency fund. No more borrowing! You have to break the cycle.\\nMyths vs.Truth\\nMyth: The debit card has more risk \\nthan a credit card.\\nTruth: Nope.\\n\\nTwist and wring out the budget, work extra hours, sell something, or have\\na garage sale, but quickly get your $1,000. Most of you should hit this step\\nin less than a month. If it looks as though it is going to take longer, do\\nsomething radical. Deliver pizzas, work part-time, or sell something else. Get\\ncrazy. You are way too close to the edge of falling over a major money cliff\\nhere. Remember, if the Joneses (all the broke people) think you are cool, you\\nare heading the wrong way. If they think you are crazy, you are probably on\\ntrack.\\nHide It\\nWhen you get the $1,000, hide it. You can’t keep the money handy, because\\nit will get spent. If your $1,000 from Baby Step One is in the underwear\\ndrawer, the pizza man will get it. No, the pizza man isn’t in your underwear\\ndrawer, but you will impulse-buy something if the money is easily accessible.\\nYou can put it in the bank savings account, but it cannot become overdraft\\nprotection. Don’t attach the savings account to your checking to protect you\\nfrom overdrafting, because then your emergency fund will get spent on\\nimpulse. I have had to learn to protect myself from me. We are not putting the\\nmoney in the bank to earn money, but rather to make it hard to get. Since\\n$1,000 at 4 percent earns only $40 per year, you aren’t getting rich here, just\\nfinding a safe place to park money.\\nGet creative. Maria, who attended one of our classes, went to her local Wal-\\nMart and bought a cheap 8\" x 10\" frame. She framed ten $100 bills in a stack.\\nIn the space within the frame she wrote, “ In case of emergency, break glass.”\\nThen she hung the emergency fund on the wall behind coats in a closet. She\\nknew the average burglar wouldn’t look there, and it would be too much\\ntrouble for her to get it out of the closet and out of the frame, so she wouldn’t\\nuse it unless there was an emergency. Whether you use a simple savings\\naccount or a frame in the coat closet, get your $1,000 quickly.\\n\\nKeep It Liquid\\nThis is a small step, so take it quickly! Don’t let this small first step last for\\nmonths! What if you already have more than $1,000? Wow, that was easy,\\nwasn’t it? If you already have the $1,000 in anything other than retirement\\nplans, get it out. If it is in a Certificate of Deposit with penalties, take the\\npenalty for early withdrawal and get it out. If it is in mutual funds, get it out.\\nIf it is in savings bonds, get it out. If it is in checking, get it out. If it is in\\nstocks or bonds, get it out. Your emergency fund, limited to $1,000 in liquid,\\navailable cash, is all that is acceptable. If you have tried to get fancy with the\\nemergency fund, you are likely to borrow to keep from “ cashing it (the cool\\ninvestment) out.” Details will come later in The Total Money Makeover\\nabout what to do with your fully funded emergency fund.\\nAll money you have above and beyond the $1,000 in anything except\\nretirement plans will be used in the next step anyway, so get ready. You\\nwon’t have this money to fall back on if the alternator on your car goes out.\\nSHOCKING STATS\\n49% of Americans could cover less than one month’s expenses if they lost their income.\\nWhat if you are at Baby Step Two in the next chapter, and you use $300\\nfrom your emergency fund to fix the alternator? If this happens, stop Step Two\\nand return to Step One until the full $1,000 is replenished. Once your\\nbeginner emergency fund is funded again, you can return to Step Two.\\nOtherwise, you will gradually do away with this small buffer and be back to\\nold habits of borrowing to cover real emergencies.\\nI know some of you think this step is very simplistic. For some this is an\\ninstantaneous step, and for others this is the first time they have ever had\\nenough control over their money to save it. For some readers, this is an easy\\n\\nstep. For others, this is the step that will be the spiritual and emotional basis\\nfor the entire Total Money Makeover.\\nLilly was such a case. A single mom with two kids, she has been divorced\\nfor eight years; struggle has been a way of life for some time. Lilly had\\nsurvival debt, not stupid, spoiled-brat debt. She had been ripped off with a\\nsuper-high-interest car loan, check-advance debt, and lots of credit-card debt.\\nShe had a take-home pay of only $1,200 per month with two baby birds to\\nfeed, along with a host of greedy rip-off lenders. Saving seemed like such a\\nfairy tale to her that she had long ago lost hope of ever being able to save\\nmoney. When I met her she had already begun her Total Money Makeover.\\nAfter hearing me teach the Baby Steps at a live event, weeks later she dropped\\nby a book signing to give me an unsolicited report.\\nAs she moved through the book line, I looked up and saw a huge grin. She\\nasked if she could give me a big hug to say thanks. How could I turn that\\ndown? As I looked at her, tears began to run down her cheeks as she gleefully\\ntold of fighting through a budget, her first ever. She told me of years of\\nstruggle. Then she laughed, and everyone in line (now fully engaged) cheered\\nwhen she said she now has $500 in cash saved. This is the first $500 in her\\nadult life that is earmarked for her emergency fund. This is the first time she\\nhas had money between her and Murphy. Her friend, Amy, who was with\\nLilly that day, told me that Lilly is a different person already. Amy said,\\n“ Even her face has changed, now that she has peace.” Don’t be confused; it\\nwasn’t $500 that did all that. What caused Lilly’s liberation was her\\nnewfound hope. She has hope that she never had before. She has hope because\\nshe has a sense of power and control over money. Money has been an enemy\\nher whole life, and now that she has tamed it, money is going to be Lilly’s\\nnew lifelong companion.\\nHow about you? Now is the time to decide. Is this theory, or is it real?\\nAm I a simpleton kook, or have I found something that works? Keep reading,\\nand we will decide together.\\n\\n7 \\nThe Debt Snowball: \\nLose Weight Fast, Really\\n \\nYour Total Money Makeover is dependent upon using your most powerful\\ntools. I believe with everything within me that your most powerful wealth-\\nbuilding tool is your income. Ideas, strategies, goals, vision, focus, and even\\ncreative thinking are vastly important, but until you get control and full use of\\nyour income to build wealth, you will not build and keep wealth. Some of\\nyou might inherit money or win a jackpot, but that is dumb luck, not a\\nproven plan to financial fitness. To build wealth, YOU will have to regain\\ncontrol of your income.\\n \\nIdentify the Enemy\\n \\nThe bottom line is that it is easy to become wealthy if you don’t have any\\npayments. You may get sick of hearing it, but the key to winning any battle\\nis to identify the enemy. The reason I am so passionate about your getting rid\\nof debt is that I have seen how many people make huge strides toward being a\\nmillionaire in the short time after they get rid of their payments. If you didn’t\\nhave a car payment, a student loan, credit cards out your ears, medical debt, or\\neven a mortgage, you could become wealthy very quickly. I know that may\\nseem like a faraway place for some of you. You might feel like a 350-pounder\\nlooking at Mr. Universe, shaking your head, thinking it will never happen for\\nyou. Let me assure you, I have walked with many 350-pounders into financial\\nfitness, so stay with me.\\n \\nThe key to winning any battle is to identify the enemy.\\n \\nThe math is revealing. The typical American with a $50,000 annual\\n\\nincome would normally have an $850 house payment and a $495 car\\npayment, with an additional $180 payment on the second car. Then there is a\\n$165 student-loan payment; and the average credit-card debt is about $12,000,\\nmaking those monthly payments around $185 per month. Also, this typical\\nhousehold will have other miscellaneous debt on things like furniture, stereos,\\nor personal loans on which they pay an additional $120. All these payments\\ntotal $1,995 per month. If this family were to invest that instead of sending it\\nto the creditors, they would be cash mutual-fund millionaires in just fifteen\\nyears! (After fifteen years, it gets really exciting. They’ll have $2 million in\\nfive more years, $3 million in three more years, $4 million in two and a half\\nmore years, and $5.5 million in two more years. So, they will have $5.5\\nmillion after twenty-eight years.) Keep in mind, this is with an average\\nincome, which means many of you make more than this! If you are thinking\\nthat you don’t have that many payments so your math won’t work, you\\nmissed the point. If you make $50,000 and have fewer payments, you have a\\nhead start, since you already have more control of your income than most\\npeople.\\nWith a take-home pay of $3,350, could you invest $1,995 if you had no\\npayments? All you have to pay for are utilities, food, clothes, insurance, and\\nother miscellaneous expenses. That would be tight, but doable. If you do that\\nfor just fifteen years, you will have a pinnacle experience. I will explain that\\nlater.\\nMany of you reading this are convinced that you could become wealthy if\\nyou could get out of debt. The problem now is that you are feeling more and\\nmore trapped by the debt. I have great news! I have a foolproof, but very\\ndifficult, method for getting out of debt. Most people won’t do it because they\\nare average, but not you. You have already figured out that if you will live\\nlike no one else, later you can live like no one else. You are sick and tired of\\nbeing sick and tired, so you are willing to pay the price for greatness. This is\\nthe toughest of all the Baby Steps to your Total Money Makeover. It is so\\nhard, but it is so worth it. This step requires the most effort, the most\\nsacrifice, and is where all your broke friends and relatives will make fun of you\\n(or join you). This step requires you to shave your head and drink the Kool-\\n\\nAid. Just kidding, but not by much. Your focused intensity has to go off the\\nscale. Remember the Albert Einstein quote from earlier in the book? “ Great\\nspirits have often encountered violent opposition from weak minds.”\\n“Great spirits have often encountered violent opposition from weak minds.”\\nIf you really believe that wealth building will no longer be a dream but a\\nreality if you have no payments, you should be willing to do bizarre and\\nsacrificial things to have no payments. Time to pay off the DEBT!\\nBaby Step Two: \\nStart the Debt Snowball\\nThe way we pay off the debt is called the Debt Snowball. The forms are on\\nthe following pages, as well as with the budget forms in the back of the book,\\nand they are part of the Financial Peace budgeting software. The Debt\\nSnowball process is simple to understand but will require truckloads of effort.\\nRemember what my pastor said: “ It isn’t complicated, but it is difficult.” We\\nhave discussed that personal finance is 80 percent behavior and 20 percent\\nhead knowledge. The Debt Snowball is designed the way it is because we are\\nmore concerned with modifying behavior than correct mathematics. (You’ll\\nsee what I mean shortly.) Being a certified nerd, I always used to start with\\nmaking the math work. I have learned that the math does need to work, but\\nsometimes motivation is more important than math. This is one of those\\ntimes.\\nTHE DEBT SNOWBALL\\nList your debts in order, with the smallest payoff or balance first. Do not be\\nconcerned with interest rates or terms unless two debts have similar payoffs,\\nthen list the higher-interest-rate debt first. Paying the little debts off first gives\\nyou quick feedback, and you are more likely to stay with the plan.\\n\\nRedo this sheet each time you pay off a debt, so you can see how close you\\nare getting to freedom. Keep the old sheets to wallpaper the bathroom in your\\nnew debt-free house. The \"New Payment\" is found by adding all the payments\\non the debts listed above that item to the payment you are working on, so\\nyou have compounding payments that will get you out of debt very quickly.\\n\"Payments Remaining\" is the number of payments remaining when you get\\ndown the snowball to that item. \"Cumulative Payments\" is the total\\npayments needed, including the snowball, to pay off that item. In other words,\\nthis is your running total for \"Payments Remaining.\"\\nCOUNTDOWN TO FREEDOM!!\\nDate:_________________\\nItem\\nTotal Payoff Minimum\\nPayment\\nNew\\nPayment\\nPayments\\nRemaining\\nCum\\nPaym\\n___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ____\\n___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ____\\n___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ____\\n___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ____\\n___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ____\\n___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ____\\n___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ____\\n___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ____\\n___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ____\\n___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ____\\n___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ____\\n___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ____\\n\\n___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ____\\n___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ____\\n___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ____\\n___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ____\\n___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ____\\n___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ____\\n___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ____\\n___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ____\\n___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ____\\n___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ____\\n___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ____\\n___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ____\\n___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ____\\n___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ____\\n___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ____\\n___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ____\\n___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ____\\n___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ____\\n___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ___________ ____\\nThe Debt Snowball method requires you to list all your debts in order of\\nsmallest payoff balance to largest. List all your debts except your home; we\\nwill get to it in another step. List all of your debts—even loans from Mom\\nand Dad or medical debts that have zero interest. I don’t care if there is\\ninterest or not. I don’t care if some have 24 percent interest and others 4\\npercent. List the debts smallest to largest! If you were so fabulous with math,\\nyou wouldn’t have debt, so try this my way. The only time to pay off a larger\\ndebt sooner than a smaller one is some kind of big-time emergency such as\\nowing the IRS and having them come after you, or in situations where there\\n\\nwill be a foreclosure if you don’t pay it off. Otherwise, don’t argue about it;\\njust list the debts smallest to largest.\\nDum Math & Stupid Tax\\nThe Eternal Car Payment\\nMost people carry a car note for their entire lives, paying about $495 a month. That\\nsame amount invested from age 25 to retirement would, on average, amount to more\\nthan $6 million by age 65. You do the math!\\nThe reason we list smallest to largest is to have some quick wins. This is\\nthe “ behavior modification over math” part I referred to earlier. Face it, if you\\ngo on a diet and lose weight the first week, you will stay on that diet. If you\\ngo on a diet and gain weight or go six weeks with no visible progress, you\\nwill quit. When training salespeople, I try to get them a sale or two quickly\\nbecause that fires them up. When you start the Debt Snowball and in the first\\nfew days pay off a couple of little debts, trust me, it lights your fire. I don’t\\ncare if you have a master’s degree in psychology; you need quick wins to get\\nfired up. And getting fired up is super-important.\\n\\n\\nIt’s funny to think that at first, I didn’t even realize we had a problem. But I started\\nlistening to Dave on the radio and read The Total Money Makeover, and I got scared. We\\nrealized that we were one accident or one job loss away from losing all we had. We simply\\nmade too much money to have six-figure debt, not including our home.\\nIt all started after we graduated, loaded with $60,000 in student-loan debt, we did what\\nwas normal. We bought a house, two new cars, and took on an additional $35,000 in credit\\ncard debt. We just didn’t bother—we weren’t trying to keep up with anyone or buy a lot of\\nmiscellaneous stuff over time—we just failed to care.\\nIt was the budget that allowed us to communicate in ways we never had before. When\\nwe saw that we could clear up a lot of debt in a relatively short period of time instead of the\\nten to twenty years we originally thought it would take, a huge amount of stress was\\nsuddenly lifted off of Amanda.\\nThe thirty-five months working on the Debt Snowball was the hardest part, but we never\\nwavered. Yes, we had visits from Murphy—having a baby plus Amanda’s back surgery and\\nother emergencies, to name a few—but we did it! We actually reached our goal of\\nbecoming DEBT-FREE!\\nWe sold our brand-new Jeep Liberty (Amanda really loved that Jeep) and bought a\\ngently used 1991 model. Amanda took on an extra shift at work, and I took over extra tasks\\naround the house to compensate. We scaled back our lifestyle considerably and folks\\n\\nmade fun of us, which told us we were on the right track. We knew that we couldn’t wander\\nout of debt like we wandered into it.\\nOur entire paradigm shifted. For the six years we’ve been married, we’ve always had\\ndebt. We have yet to have a major argument over money since we started this plan. We\\nknow that we can do anything we want in a short time. We literally changed our family tree\\n—all because we bothered and cared enough to do something about it.\\nSteven (age 32) and \\nAmanda (age 31) Farrar \\neBay Store Owner; Pharmacist\\nOne lady took her Debt Snowball form to the local copy shop and had it\\nenlarged to supersize. She then put her huge Debt Snowball on the\\nrefrigerator. Every time she paid off another debt, she drew a big red line\\nthrough that debt, now gone forever. She told me that every time she walked\\nthrough the kitchen and looked at that refrigerator door, she would yell, “ Oh\\nyeah, we are getting out of debt!” If that sounds corny to you, you are still not\\ngetting it. This lady has a PhD. She is not a dumb person. She is so\\nsophisticated and intelligent that she got it. She understood that her Total\\nMoney Makeover was about a change in behavior, and that behavioral change\\nis best enhanced by some quick (although small) wins.\\nWhen you pay off a nagging $52 medical bill or that $122 cell-phone bill\\nfrom eight months ago, your life is not changed that much mathematically yet.\\nYou have, however, begun a process that works, and you have seen it work,\\nand you will keep doing it because you will be fired up about the fact that it\\nworks.\\nAfter you list the debts smallest to largest, pay the minimum payment to\\nstay current on all the debts except the smallest. Every dollar you can find\\nfrom anywhere in your budget goes toward the smallest debt until it is paid.\\nOnce the smallest is paid, the payment from that debt, plus any extra “ found”\\nmoney, is added to the next smallest debt. (Trust me, once you get going,\\nyou will find money.) Then, when debt number two is paid off, you take the\\nmoney that you used to pay on number one and number two and you pay it,\\nplus any found money, on number three. When three is paid, you attack four,\\n\\nand so on. Keep paying minimums on all the debts except the smallest until\\nit is paid. Every time you pay one off, the amount you pay on the next one\\ndown increases. All the money from old debts and all the money you can find\\nanywhere goes on the smallest until it is gone. Attack! Every time the\\nSnowball rolls over, it picks up more snow and gets larger, and by the time\\nyou get to the bottom, you have an avalanche.\\nMost people get to the bottom of the list and find that now they can pay\\nwell over $1,000 per month on a car loan or a student loan. At that point, it\\nwon’t take long to bust out and be debt-free except for the house. That is\\nBaby Step Two: Use the Debt Snowball to become debt-free except for your\\nhome.\\nMy wife and I were under twenty-five and had over $169,000 in debt. We were sick and\\ntired of being sick and tired! Our debt had grown little by little. Amy would buy small things\\nlike clothes and stuff for the house that seemed to nickel and dime us to death. I, on the\\nother hand, would blow money on a larger scale. For example, I bought a BMW (for Amy,\\nof course) and took her on a surprise vacation to New York City. We did not yet have the\\ndiscipline to tell that inner child to shut up long enough for us to think before we made a\\npurchase.\\nWe did not have the urgency to get rid of our huge amount of debt until a turn in events\\nchanged our mind-set. Several years ago, I changed jobs, which required a training period\\nthat decreased my monthly income by $4,000. We had some money in savings, but it\\nquickly dwindled. To start our Total Money Makeover, we decided we had to lower our\\n\\noverhead, sell everything but the kids (maybe), and change our spending habits.\\nWe got crazy and sold our rental property, and we paid off the BMW, department-store\\ncard, medical bills, and student loan. We were invited to do fun stuff, and to spend money\\ndoing it, but we held off. We decided to have a garage sale that ended up looking like an\\nestate sale; we ate “creative” meals, and then I committed what some people would\\nconsider the ultimate sin: I sold my wife’s BMW. We knew if our family of four could just\\nmake it through these six months living on only $1,700 a month, we could ultimately\\nchange our family tree. And we did it! We became debt-free except for the house and\\nwere named one of the Total Money Makeover finalists!\\nThe most important part of this whole process was learning to delay pleasure. It’s like\\nDave says, “Live like no one else, so later you can live like no one else!”\\nJosh (age 26) and \\nAmy (age 25) Hopkins \\nMortgage Loan Officer; \\nStay-at-Home Mom\\nThe Elements of Making It Work\\nWhen I first started teaching this more than twenty years ago, I didn’t\\nunderstand what all the elements of success were or all the clarifications that\\nwould be needed. The major elements of making the Debt Snowball work are\\nusing a budget, getting current before you start, smallest-to-largest payoff (no\\ncheating), sacrifice, and focused intensity. Total, sold-out, focused intensity is\\npossibly the most important. This means saying to yourself (and meaning it),\\nTo the exclusion of virtually everything else, I’m getting out of debt! If you\\ntake an old-fashioned magnifying glass outside and set it near some crumpled\\nnewspapers, nothing will happen. If you point the sun’s rays through the\\nmagnifying glass but move it around or wiggle it, nothing will happen. If you\\nhold really still and focus the sun’s rays totally on that crumpled newspaper,\\nthings begin to happen. Focused intensity will cause you to smell something\\nburning, and soon you will see an actual fire.\\nIf you think this Debt Snowball stuff is cute and you might sort of give it a\\n\\ntry, it won’t work. Total, sold-out, focused intensity is required to win.\\nAiming at the goal and nothing else is the only way to win. You have to\\nknow where you are going, and by definition know where you aren’t going, or\\nyou will never get there. I fly a lot, and I never get on a plane and think to\\nmyself, I wonder where this plane is heading? I know where I want to go,\\nand if I’m heading to New York, I stay off the plane heading to Detroit. When\\nI get off the plane, I don’t catch the first cab I see and say, “ Why don’t we\\njust drive around a while because I don’t have a plan.” I tell them the hotel\\nand street where I want to go. I then ask how long that will take and what the\\nfare will be. My point is that we don’t wander aimlessly around in any other\\nparts of our lives, but we seem to think that will work with money. You can’t\\nget ready, fire, and then aim with money, and you can’t try to do six things at\\nthe same time. You are trying to get out of debt. Period. You will have to\\nfocus with great intensity to do it.\\nTo the exclusion of virtually everything else, I’m getting out of debt!\\nProverbs 6:1 and 5 (loosely Dave-paraphrased) says, “ If you have signed\\nsurety, my son, [surety is Bible talk for debt] . . . deliver yourself like the\\nbird from the hand of the fowler and the gazelle from the hand of the hunter.” I\\nremember reading that Bible verse in my daily Bible study one day and\\nthinking what a cute little animal metaphor it was for getting out of debt.\\nThen one day later that week I was surfing channels and hit the Discovery\\nChannel. I noticed they were filming gazelles. The gazelles were peacefully\\ngazelling around. Of course, you know the Discovery Channel wasn’t there\\njust for the gazelles. The next camera shot was of Mr. Cheetah sneaking up in\\nthe bushes looking for lunch in all the right places. Suddenly, one of the\\ngazelles got a whiff of Mr. Cheetah and became very aware of his plan. The\\nother gazelles noticed the alarm and soon also were on edge. They couldn’t\\nyet see the cheetah, so out of fear of running at him, they froze until he played\\nhis cards.\\nRealizing he had been discovered, Mr. Cheetah decided to give it his best\\nshot and leaped from the bushes. The gazelles all yelled, “ Cheetah!” Well,\\nnot really, but they did run like crazy in fourteen different directions. The\\n\\nDiscovery Channel that day reminded viewers that the cheetah is the fastest\\nmammal on dry land; he can go from zero to forty-five miles per hour in four\\nleaps. The show also proved that because the gazelle will outmaneuver the\\ncheetah instead of outrunning him, the cheetah will tire quickly. As a matter\\nof fact, the cheetah only gets his gazelle burger for lunch in one out of nineteen\\nchases. The gazelle’s primary hunter is the fastest mammal on dry ground, yet\\nthe gazelle wins almost every time. Likewise, the way out of debt is to\\noutmaneuver the enemy and run for your life.\\nThe way out of debt is to outmaneuver the enemy and run for your life.\\nAround our office, the counselors can predict who will make it out of debt\\nbased on how “ gazelle-intense” they are. If they are looking at a red line on\\nthe refrigerator door and yelling, they have a really good shot. However, if\\nthey are looking for a get-rich-quick scheme or some intellectual theory\\ninstead of sacrifice, hard work, and total focus, we give them a really low\\ngazelle rating and a low probability of becoming debt-free.\\nI was first introduced to Dave through his radio show The Dave Ramsey Show. I was\\nhooked right away. I was really inspired to read The Total Money Makeover and signed\\nmyself up to be a facilitator of Dave’s Financial Peace University at my church. His\\n\\nprinciples just make sense. They are so simple and very relevant to everyone. I simply\\nneeded to wake up and start paying more attention to my spending habits. It was all up to\\nme.\\nImmediately after beginning his plan and creating a budget, I realized how stupid I had\\nbeen. I spent too much of my life wasting so much money! With a cash-flow plan in place, I\\nfelt more in control. I was telling my money where it should go instead of wondering where\\nit went. It was a very freeing experience.\\nOnce I made the decision to change my mind-set and start living more responsibly, I\\nwas ready to embrace the Seven Baby Steps. My first inclination was to save money first,\\ninvest in retirement, and then pay off my debt. I was so wrong. If I had done it my way, I\\nwould still be struggling. I would still be a slave to my lenders.\\nStarting the Debt Snowball really got me fired up. It was amazing to see my debt\\ngradually become smaller and smaller while my snowball became larger and larger. I was\\nso proud of my progress that became more and more evident with every month. Just to be\\nable to make small accomplishments made a tremendous amount of difference. It\\ncontinuously gave me hope throughout this process. Granted, I did not have or earn a lot\\nof money to put toward becoming debt-free. But I think that made it all the more\\nincredible. I knew I just had to make it work. The ability to become debt-free isn’t\\ncontingent upon a certain income. It is all about changing behavior and being intense\\nabout getting rid of that nasty debt!\\nYears ago I was simply ignorant when it came to debt. My family didn’t talk about that\\nstuff. I just thought debt was something everyone had. Thank God I now know differently\\nand can start living the life I deserve!\\nDeLisa Dangerfield (age 42) \\nRegistered Nurse\\nAn obvious step to working the Debt Snowball is to stop borrowing.\\nOtherwise, you will just be changing the names of the creditors on your debt\\nlist. So you must draw a line in the sand and say, “ I will never borrow\\nagain.” As soon as you make that statement, there will be a test. Trust me.\\nYour transmission will go out. Your kid will need braces. It is almost as if\\nGod wants to see if you are really gazelle-intense. At this point, you are ready\\nfor a plastectomy—plastic surgery to cut up your credit cards. I’m often asked,\\n“ Dave, should I cut my cards up now or when I pay them off?” Cut them up\\n\\nNOW. A permanent change in your view of debt is your only chance. No\\nmatter what happens, you have to pursue the opportunity or solve the\\nchallenge without debt. It has to stop. If you think you can get out of debt\\nwithout huge resolve to stop borrowing, you are wrong. You can’t get out of\\na hole by digging out the bottom.\\nHow to Get the Snowball Rolling\\nSometimes your Debt Snowball won’t roll. When some people do their\\nbudget, there is barely enough to make all the minimum payments and\\nnothing extra to pay on the smallest. There is no push to get the Snowball\\nrolling. Let me offer another image to help you better understand this problem\\nand the solution. My great-great-grandfather ran a timber operation in the hills\\nof Kentucky and West Virginia. In that bygone era, after cutting the timber,\\nthey would put the logs into the river to float them downstream to the\\nsawmill. The logs would build up at a bend in the river, and a traffic jam of\\nwood occurred. This would continue as long as the jammed-up area stopped\\nthe progress of the other logs. Sometimes the loggers could break the jam\\nloose by pushing the logs. Other times they would have to get radical before a\\nreal mess occurred.\\nDave Rants...\\nRemember, just because one of you is keeping the checkbook, this does not mean that this\\nperson makes all the financial decisions.\\nWhen it got bad, they would break the logjam by throwing dynamite into\\nthe middle of the logs that were blocking the progress. As you can imagine,\\nthis created a dramatic effect. When the dynamite blew, logs and pieces of logs\\nwould fly into the air. After working so hard to cut the trees, some of them\\nwere a total loss. They had to blow up some of the timber to get the rest of\\nthe crop to market. That’s the sacrifice the situation required. Sometimes that\\n\\nis what you have to do with the stopped-up budget. You have to dynamite it.\\nYou have to get radical to get the money flowing again.\\nOne way to do that is to sell something. You could sell lots of little stuff at\\na garage sale, sell a seldom-used item on the Internet, or sell a precious item\\nthrough the classifieds. Get gazelle-intense and sell so much stuff that the kids\\nare afraid they are next. Sell things that make your broke friends question your\\nsanity. If your budget is stopped-up and your Debt Snowball won’t roll on its\\nown, you are going to have to get radical.\\nIn watching heroes across the nation get out of debt with gazelle intensity,\\nbelieve me, I have seen them sell things. One lady sold 350 goldfish from her\\npond for a dollar apiece. Men have sold their Harleys, boats, knife collections,\\nor baseball cards. Ladies have sold precious things like nonfamily antiques\\n(keep the heirlooms because you can’t get them back) or a personal car they\\nthought was necessary to life on the planet. I don’t recommend selling your\\nhome unless you have payments above 45 percent of your monthly take-home\\npay. Usually, the home isn’t the problem. I do recommend that most people\\nsell the car with the most debt on it. A good rule of thumb on items (except\\nthe house) is this: if you can’t be debt-free on it (not counting the home) in\\neighteen to twenty months, sell it. If you have a car or a boat that you can’t\\npay off in eighteen to twenty months, sell it. It is just a car; dynamite the\\nlogjam! I used to love my car, too, but I found keeping that huge debt while\\ntrying to get out of debt was like running a race wearing ankle weights. Get a\\nTotal Money Makeover, so later you can drive anything you want and pay\\ncash for it. When it comes to that debt-ridden item, you may have to make\\nthe decision to live like no one else, but remember, later you will be living,\\nor driving, like no one else.\\nIt is just a car; dynamite the logjam!\\n\\nMy wife and I considered credit cards to be just a way of life. It seemed “normal” to\\nsimply throw down the cards for everyday items. Vacation rentals, gas, clothes, food—you\\nname it, we paid for it with plastic. Eventually, all of those charges started piling up. It was\\na gradual and steady accumulation of debt that just kept growing and growing. It was like a\\nsnowball that was chasing us instead of us pushing it. All this time I had left my wife to\\nhandle the money and didn’t give it a second thought, which wasn’t fair to her. The next\\nthing we knew, we were $30,000 in debt and in need of a Total Money Makeover.\\nWe had four credit cards with different balances totaling around $25,000. The other\\n$5,000 we owed to the IRS. That was really scary. Needless to say, we attacked the IRS\\ndebt first and furiously knocked it out in just three months. Once we were current with all of\\nour payments, we started attacking the credit-card debt. We threw every spare dime we\\ncould at it. Today we are debt-free except for the house, and we are building our three- to\\nsix-month emergency fund.\\nIt was definitely hard learning how to say “NO!” to ourselves. For the first time as a\\ncouple, we knew we had to make a budget and really stick to it. It wasn’t as easy as it\\nsounds, but the payoff has been immeasurable. Once we got used to this lifestyle,\\neverything just seemed to be less stressful. We found contentment and became happier\\nthan we had ever been.\\nI know now that this debt was as much my fault as it was my wife’s. Just because we\\nagreed she’d be “in charge of the checkbook” didn’t let me off the hook. I realize now that\\nit was wrong to leave her to handle all the financial responsibilities. If a spouse has been\\n\\nkeeping financial secrets, it’s definitely for the best to get them out in the open. It’s the\\nonly way these problems can get solved. There may be some anger at first and even some\\nfeelings of betrayal. Nevertheless, a marriage can only improve with unobstructed\\ncommunication. The key is to hang on to each other and enjoy the ride out of the mess that\\nyou BOTH created.\\nJeff (age 41) and \\nTeresa (age 41) Eller \\nOwner of a dump-truck \\ncompany; Medical Manager\\nThe number of people I talk to about this who will not throw dynamite\\ninto their logjam to get the money flowing makes me sad. They can see that\\nthe logs will never get to market, they will never have wealth, but they just\\ncan’t stand the thought of blowing up a few of them so the rest will get down\\nthe river. Translation: “ I love my stupid car more than the idea of becoming\\nwealthy enough to give cars away.” Don’t make that mistake.\\nThere is another method of breaking your logjam that the lumberjacks\\ndidn’t have available to them. More water would have pushed the logs around\\nthat corner, too, if they could have flooded the river. I may be stretching this\\nmetaphor, but more income will also break up your logjam; it will push the\\nSnowball. If your budget is too tight to get the Debt Snowball rolling, you\\nneed to do something to increase income. Selling debt-ridden items lowers\\nthe outgo, and selling other items temporarily increases your income.\\nLikewise, working extra hours can increase income in order to increase the\\nspeed of debt repayment.\\nSHOCKING STATS\\n60% of Americans don’t pay off their credit cards every month.\\nI don’t like the idea of working one hundred hours per week, but\\nsometimes extreme situations require extreme solutions. Temporarily, just for\\na manageable period of time, the extra job or overtime may be your solution. I\\n\\nmet Randy while doing a book signing in a major city. Randy was two\\nmonths from being debt-free. He is twenty-six years old and has paid off\\n$78,000 in debt in twenty-one months. He sold a car and works ten hours a\\nday, seven days a week. Randy is not a doctor or a lawyer; he is a plumber.\\nSome lawyers would argue that plumbers make more than they do, and in\\nsome cases they might be right. Randy’s one-man plumbing company has\\nprospered. He had already worked that morning before coming with his wife\\nand little girl to the bookstore. His wife smiled as she looked at her husband\\nwith deep respect and told me she hadn’t seen him much this last year, but it\\nwas going to be worth it soon. Can you imagine the pressure that young\\nmarriage must have been under with $78,000 in debt? Now they are almost\\nfree.\\nRandy got radical. He used income to bust the logjam. He promised me he\\nwas going to slow down as soon as the debt was paid so he could spend time\\nwith his wife and little girl. Now they will be able to go places as a family\\nand do things their debt would never have allowed them to do.\\nI picked up a pizza one night, and as the guy behind the counter started\\nwalking toward his car with a stack of pizzas to be delivered, he saw me and\\nstopped. Smiling, he said, “ Hey, Dave, I’m here because of you. Only three\\nmore months, and I’m debt-free!” This was not some seventeen-year-old\\nteenager; this was a dad, a thirty-five-year-old guy who wants to be free. There\\nis a young single guy who works on my team. He is gazelle-intense about\\nbecoming debt-free. He works here until 5:30 every day, and he smiles as he\\nleaves to work for UPS for another four or five hours virtually every night.\\nMyths vs.Truth\\nMyth: I’ll just file bankruptcy and start over; it seems so easy.\\nTruth: Bankruptcy is a gut-wrenching, life-changing event that causes lifelong damage.\\n\\nWhy are these guys all smiling? They work hard and unbelievable extra\\nhours, so why would they smile? They smile because they have caught the\\nvision, the vision of living like no one else so later they can live like no one\\nelse.\\nWhat About Saving for Retirement While the Snowball’s Rolling?\\nMatt asked me on the radio show about another subject people have trouble\\nwith on Baby Step Two. Matt wanted to know if he should stop his 401k\\ncontributions to get his Debt Snowball moving. He really didn’t want to stop\\ncontributing, especially the first 3 percent because his company matches that\\n100 percent. I am a math nerd, and I know the 100 percent match is sweet,\\nbut I have seen something more powerful— focused intensity. If you are going\\nto be gazelle-intense and do everything in your power to become debt-free very\\nquickly, then stop your retirement plan contributions, even if your company\\nmatches them. The power of focus and quick wins is more important in the\\nlong term to your Total Money Makeover than is the match. This is only for\\npeople who have already pulled out all the stops and are ready for “ anything\\ngoes” to become debt-free quickly.\\nIf you are radically gazelle-intense, the speed of your debt freedom will\\nenable you to return to that 401k with the match in just a matter of months.\\nImagine how much you’ll be able to contribute without payments. The\\naverage person who throws the dynamite and is gazelle-intense will be debt-\\nfree except for his or her home in eighteen months. Some take longer and\\nothers less, depending on debt, income, and savings at the time they start\\ntheir Total Money Makeover. If for some reason you are stuck in an extremely\\ndeep hole, you may want to continue doing some retirement saving. An\\nextremely deep hole is NOT defined by your unwillingness to apply yourself.\\nAn extremely deep hole is not Phil’s situation.\\nPhil makes $120,000 per year and has $70,000 of debt, $32,000 of which is\\non one car. Sell the car and amputate the lifestyle, Phil. Phil should be debt-\\nfree in nine months, no excuses and no prisoners. An extremely deep hole is\\n\\nTammy’s situation. Tammy has $74,000 in student loans with another\\n$15,000 in credit-card debt. Tammy is a single mom with three children and\\nhas an income of $24,000 per year. It is going to take Tammy a few years to\\nwork her Debt Snowball. She will figure a way through it, but her situation is\\none of the very rare exceptions; she should keep contributing to the 401k with\\nthe match.\\nWhen You Have to Dip Into the Emergency Fund\\nPenny’s air conditioner went out in the dead of summer. The repairs were\\n$650, which she took from her emergency fund. “ Thank goodness that $1,000\\nwas there,” she said with a sigh. Now what does she do? The Debt Snowball,\\nor stop and go back to Baby Step One (save $1,000)? Penny needs to put the\\nDebt Snowball temporarily on hold. She will continue to make minimum\\npayments and go back to the first step until she gets back up to $1,000 in her\\nemergency fund. If she doesn’t, soon she will have nothing in savings, and\\nwhen the alternator on the car goes out, she will reopen some credit-card\\naccount. The same applies to you. If you use the emergency fund, return to\\nBaby Step One until you have re-funded your beginner emergency fund, then\\nmove right back to your Debt Snowball, Baby Step Two.\\nSecond Mortgages, Business Debt, and Rental Property Mortgages\\nBecause of debt-consolidation loans and other mistakes, many people have a\\nhome equity loan or some kind of large second mortgage. What should be\\ndone with this loan? Is it put in the Debt Snowball, or just called a mortgage\\nand not dealt with at this step? It will be paid off; it is just a matter of at\\nwhich step. Generally speaking, if your second mortgage is more than 50\\npercent of your gross annual income, you should not put it in the Debt\\nSnowball. We will get to it later. If you make $40,000 per year and have a\\n$15,000 second mortgage, you should put it in the Debt Snowball. Let’s just\\ntake care of it now. But if you have a $35,000 second mortgage and make\\n$40,000, you will get to it in another step. By the way, you should consider\\n\\nrefinancing your first and second mortgages together if you can lower both\\ninterest rates. Then put the total on a fifteen-year mortgage, or the remaining\\nyears of your current first mortgage, whichever is less (e.g., if you have twelve\\nyears remaining on your first mortgage at 9 percent interest, refinance the first\\nand second mortgages together into a new first at 6 percent over twelve years\\nor less).\\nMany small-business owners have debt and want to know how to handle\\nthat debt in the Debt Snowball. Most small-business debt is personally\\nguaranteed, which means it is really personal debt. If you have a small-\\nbusiness loan of $15,000 at the bank or have borrowed on your credit cards for\\nbusiness, this is personal debt. Treat small-business debt like any other kind\\nof debt. List it with all your other debts, smallest to largest, in the Debt\\nSnowball. If your business debt is larger than half your gross annual income\\nor half your home mortgage, hold the payoff on that size debt until later.\\nSmaller and medium-sized debts are what we want to pay off at this step.\\nThe only other larger debts to delay are mortgages on rental properties.\\nStop buying more rental property, but hold that debt until later. After your\\nhome mortgage is paid off in a later Baby Step, you should Snowball your\\nrental mortgages. List the rental debts smallest to largest, and concentrate all\\nyour focus on the smallest until paid. Then work your way through the rest. If\\nyou own several, or even just one, rental property, you should consider\\nselling some or all to get the money to pay off the ones you keep or pay off\\nother debt listed in the Debt Snowball. Having $40,000 in credit-card debt\\nand a rental with $40,000 equity doesn’t make sense. You wouldn’t borrow\\n$40,000 on credit cards to buy a rental, I hope. So why would you keep the\\nsituation described here, which has the same effect?\\nOther than the home mortgage, larger second mortgages, business loans,\\nand rental mortgages are the only things that aren’t paid off in Baby Step Two\\n(Start the Debt Snowball). With gazelle intensity, great focus, extreme\\nsacrifice, selling things, and working extra, we clear all debt. Again, if you are\\nfired up, normally this will happen within eighteen to twenty months. Some\\n\\nwill get out of debt sooner, and some will get out in a slightly longer period\\nof time. If your Snowball is scheduled to run longer, never fear; it may not\\ntake as long as the math seems to indicate. Many people find a way to shorten\\nthe time with sheer intensity, and God tends to pour blessings on people\\ngoing in a direction He wants them to go. It is as if you are walking or\\nrunning at a fast pace, and a moving sidewalk suddenly appears below you to\\ncarry you faster than your own effort would.\\nGod tends to pour blessings on people going in a direction He wants them to go.\\nThe Debt Snowball is very possibly the most important step in your Total\\nMoney Makeover for two reasons. One, you free up your most powerful\\nwealth-building tool, your income, during this step. Two, you take on the\\nentire American culture by declaring war on debt. By paying off your debt,\\nyou make a statement about your stance on the issue of debt. By paying off\\nyour debt, you show that The Total Money Makeover of your heart has\\noccurred, paving the way for a Total Money Makeover of your actual wealth.\\n\\n8 \\nFinish the Emergency Fund: \\nKick Murphy Out\\n \\nClose your eyes and think about what it will be like when you reach this\\nBaby Step. Most gazelle-intense participants in a Total Money Makeover will\\narrive at the beginning of Baby Step Three in around eighteen to twenty\\nmonths. When you reach this step, you have $1,000 cash and no debt except\\nyour home mortgage. You have pushed with such focused intensity that the\\nball is now rolling, and you have momentum on your side. Again, close your\\neyes and breathe in. Think about what it will feel like when you are debt-free\\nexcept for the house and have $1,000 cash. Did I see you smiling?\\n \\nYou are beginning to see the power of being in control of your largest\\nwealth-building tool, your income. Now that you don’t have any payments,\\nexcept the house, Baby Step Three should come quickly.\\nBaby Step Three: \\nFinish the Emergency Fund\\n \\nA fully funded emergency fund covers three to six months of expenses. What\\nwould it take for you to live three to six months if you lost your income?\\nFinancial Planners and Financial Counselors like myself have used this rule of\\nthumb for years, and it has served my Total Money Makeover participants\\nwell. You start the emergency fund with $1,000, but a fully funded emergency\\nfund will usually range from $5,000 to $25,000. The typical family that can\\nmake it on $3,000 per month might have a $10,000 emergency fund as a\\nminimum. What would it feel like to have no payments but the house, and\\n$10,000 in savings for when it rains?\\n \\nRemember what we said about emergencies a couple of chapters back? It\\n\\nwill rain; you need an umbrella. Don’t forget, Money magazine says that 78\\npercent of us will have a major unexpected event within the next ten years.\\nWhen the big stuff happens, like the job layoff or the blown car engine, you\\ncan’t depend on credit cards. If you use debt to cover emergencies, you have\\nbacktracked again. A well-designed Total Money Makeover will walk you out\\nof debt forever. A strong foundation in your financial house includes the big\\nsavings account, which will be used just for emergencies.\\nAfter my divorce, I found myself homeless, pregnant, and raising my 18-month-old son\\nalone. Plus, I was stuck with all the debt from the failed marriage! I went from two incomes\\nand one child, to one income and two children. I started living off of credit cards out of\\nnecessity, racking up piles of debt as I went along. I moved into public housing and lived\\nthere for two years, trying to take care of my kids and stay current on the bills.\\nIt was tough feeling like I couldn’t provide for my family; I wanted more for my\\nchildren. They have gone without birthday parties and other little things that kids their age\\nhave. They have never had a place to call home, and that’s my strongest drive in getting\\nout of debt.\\n\\nI know firsthand the importance of an emergency fund. For the first time in my life, I\\nhad money in the bank when my truck broke down. I didn’t have to go into debt, and my\\nincome wasn’t affected. I just paid the mechanic and refilled my emergency fund as soon\\nas possible. Then, I went right back to paying off my debts. It was time-consuming and\\ntedious, but worth it to have the security that the emergency fund provided.\\nIt hasn’t been easy. Just about every time I’ve gotten within a few dollars of having my\\nemergency fund back in place, something has happened, and I’ve had to use it again. But\\nit is now standard practice to refill my emergency fund whenever I use it—it has saved my\\nfamily from a lot of hard times and from going further into debt.\\nRebecca Gonzalez (age 28) \\nHuman Resources Assistant\\nI’m going to bang on this drum again because it is vital if your makeover\\nis going to be permanent. The worst time to borrow is when times are bad. If\\nthere is a recession and you lose your job (read, “ no income”), you don’t\\nwant to have a bunch of debt. In a recent Gallup poll, 56 percent of Americans\\nsaid they would borrow on a credit card if a rainy day came, and it wouldn’t\\nbe difficult. I agree it wouldn’t be difficult because credit cards are issued to\\ndogs and dead people every year, but that doesn’t mean it would be smart.\\nWhat would be difficult is to make the payments and even pay off the debt if\\nyou don’t get that new replacement job. A Country Financial Security Index\\nsurvey found that 49 percent of Americans could cover less than one month’s\\nexpenses if they lost their income. Half of this culture has virtually no buffer\\nbetween them and life. Here comes Murphy! Remember how we discussed\\nthat problems seem to be (and I believe actually are) less frequent when you\\nhave your fully funded emergency fund? Don’t forget that the emergency fund\\nactually acts as Murphy repellent.\\nSo, what is an emergency anyway? An emergency is something you had no\\nway of knowing was coming, something that has a major impact on you and\\nyour family if you don’t cover it. Emergencies include paying the deductible\\non medical, homeowner’s, or car insurance after an accident, a job loss or\\ncutback, medical bills resulting from an accident or unforeseen medical\\nproblem, or a blown transmission or engine in a car that you need to function.\\nAll of these are emergencies. Something on sale that you “ need” is not an\\n\\nemergency. Fixing the boat, unless you live on it, is not an emergency. “ I\\nwant to start a business” is not an emergency. “ I want to buy a car or a leather\\ncouch or go to Cancún” is not an emergency. Prom dresses and college tuition\\nare not emergencies. Beware not to rationalize the use of your emergency fund\\nfor something that you should save for and purchase. On the other hand, don’t\\nmake payments on medical bills after an accident while your emergency fund\\nsits there fully funded. If you’ve gone to the trouble of creating an emergency\\nfund, make sure you are crystal clear on what is and is not an emergency.\\nBeware not to rationalize the use of your emergency fund for something that you should\\nsave for and purchase.\\nBefore using the emergency fund, back up from the situation and calm\\ndown. Sharon and I would never use the emergency fund without first\\ndiscussing it and being in agreement. We also would never use the emergency\\nfund without sleeping on the decision and praying about it. Our agreement,\\nour prayer, and our cooling-off period all help us determine if this decision is a\\nrationalization, a reaction, or a real emergency.\\nThe Emergency Fund Must Be Easy to Access\\nKeep your emergency fund in something that is liquid. Liquid is a money\\nterm that means easy to get to with no penalties. If you would hesitate to use\\nthe fund because of the penalties you’ll incur to get to it, you have it in the\\nwrong place. I use growth-stock mutual funds for long-term investing, but I\\nwould never put my emergency fund there. If my car engine blew, I would be\\ntempted to borrow to fix it rather than cash in my mutual fund because the\\nmarket is down (we always want to wait on it to go back up). That means I\\nhave the emergency fund in the wrong place. Mutual funds are good long-term\\ninvestments, but because of market fluctuations, you are likely to have an\\nemergency when the market is down—another invitation to Murphy. So keep\\nyour emergency fund liquid!\\n\\nSHOCKING STATS\\n56% of Americans said they would borrow on a credit card if a rainy day came.\\nFor the same reason, don’t use Certificates of Deposit for your emergency\\nfund because typically you will be charged a penalty for making an early\\nwithdrawal. The exception to this is if you can get some kind of “ quick-\\nrelease” CD that allows one withdrawal during the committed period without\\npenalty. That quick release makes the money available to you without penalty\\nand would make that CD a good emergency fund. Understand, you don’t want\\nto “ invest” the emergency fund, just have it someplace safe and easy to get to.\\nIf you already have emergency-fund money someplace it shouldn’t be, use\\nyour head if a true emergency hits you. Christine, a sixty-nine-year-old\\ngrandmother, told me she borrowed to fix her transmission because she didn’t\\nwant to pay a penalty to cash out her CD. The loan was her “ wise” banker’s\\nsuggestion, and Christine trusted her banker. The only problem is, even with\\nthe penalty, Christine would have been better off to cash out her CD. The\\nrepair cost was $3,000. Her CD earned 5 percent, and the penalty for cashing\\nit out early was half the interest. So her banker loaned her $3,000 at 9 percent\\ninterest so she wouldn’t lose 2.5 percent in penalties. Doesn’t sound too wise\\nto me. Honestly, it doesn’t sound too ethical to me either. Words are\\npowerful; none of us want to be “ penalized.” When emotions took over,\\nChristine trusted instead of thinking and made a bad decision.\\nI suggest a Money Market account with no penalties and full checkwriting\\nprivileges for your emergency fund. We have a large emergency fund for our\\nhousehold in a mutual-fund company Money Market account. Wherever you\\nget your mutual funds, look at the Web site to find Money Market accounts\\nthat pay interest equal to one-year CDs. I haven’t found bank Money Market\\naccounts to be competitive. The FDIC does not insure the mutual-fund\\nMoney Market accounts, but I keep mine there anyway because I’ve never\\nknown one to fail. Keep in mind that the interest earned is not the main thing.\\nThe main thing is that the money is available to cover emergencies. Your\\n\\nwealth building is not going to happen in this account; that will come later,\\nin other places. This account is more like insurance against rainy days than\\ninvesting.\\nDum Math & Stupid Tax\\nShocking Numbers on Winning the Lottery\\nOf people making less than $35,000 per year, 40 percent said the best way for them to\\nhave $500,000 at retirement age is to win the lottery. Your chances of winning the lottery\\nare about 1 in 120 million. You’re 400 times more likely to be struck by lightning.\\nSometimes, even after I’ve explained all this, people still ask about savings\\nbonds, bonds, or other “ low-risk” investments. They are missing the point.\\nAgain, this emergency fund is not for wealth building. You will get other\\nkinds of return on investment from this account, but the purpose of this\\nmoney is not to make you rich. The mission statement for the emergency fund\\nis to protect you against storms, give you peace of mind, and keep the next\\nproblem from becoming debt.\\nHow Big?\\nSo, how much money should be in your emergency fund? We said it should\\nbe enough to cover three to six months of expenses, but should you go with\\nthree months or six months? If you think about the purpose of this fund, it\\nwill help you determine what is right for you. The purpose of the fund is to\\nabsorb risk, so the more risky your situation, the greater the emergency fund\\nyou should have. For example, if you earn straight commission or are self-\\nemployed, you should use the six-months rule. If you are single or you are a\\none-income married household, you should use the six-months rule because a\\njob loss in your situation is a 100 percent cut in household income. If your\\njob situation is unstable or there are chronic medical problems in the family,\\n\\nyou, too, should lean toward the six-months rule.\\nI grew up in government-assisted housing (the projects) and, for a long time, thought that’s\\nhow the remainder of my life was supposed to be lived. However, when I was twenty-four\\nyears old, the Lord provided me with a job that challenged me intellectually and\\ncontinually pushed me to think outside the box. I began to listen to the news and political\\ndiscussions on the radio, and one day I happened to stumble across a funny white guy\\nnamed Dave.\\nAfter listening to Dave, it took a few years for my wife and me to get onboard. When we\\nfinally did decide to have a Total Money Makeover, the hardest part was getting mad\\nenough to eliminate all our debt at once. We continued to make purchases on our credit\\ncard and would find ourselves back at square one. But reality set in once I was laid off\\nfrom my job. We couldn’t afford to make ends meet. I felt like such a failure because I\\nknew that if I had stuck to Dave’s plan and advice, we would have been in a much better\\nsituation.\\nAfter that initial layoff, we struggled for a while until I finally landed a new job. Yet, we\\nhave become debt-free because we all work together and do our part to assure the\\nfinancial success of our present and future. The level of accountability that is required is\\ntremendous! We fought a lot at the beginning, but as we’ve worked through things, our\\ncommunication has become smooth and hassle-free. We have been patient and diligent in\\nour budgeting and are now reaping the benefits!\\n\\nOur family is still realizing the full impact of being debt-free. The month after we paid off\\nthe debt, I was laid off again. But this time we were in a completely different place than\\nbefore. The financial worries and strains were nonexistent. There is a sense of peace that\\nsurpasses all understanding, and until you have experienced it for yourself, you can’t even\\nimagine its amazing power.\\nJames (age 32) and \\nTabitha (age 31) Atwood \\nTrain Conductor; \\nMerchandising Coordinator\\nIf you have a “ steady, secure” job where you have been with that company\\nor government agency for fifteen years and everyone is healthy, you could lean\\ntoward the three-month rule. A real estate agent should have a six-month fund,\\nand a healthy postal worker who has been in her job for years and plans to\\nstay might keep a three-month fund. Customize your emergency fund to your\\nsituation and to how your spouse deals with the feeling of risk. Many times\\nmen and ladies deal with this subject differently. This fund is for actual\\nprotection and for peace of mind, so the spouse who wants this fund to be\\nhigher wins.\\nWe use three to six months of expenses instead of three to six months of\\nincome because the fund is to cover expenses, not replace income. If you\\nbecome ill or lose a job, you need to keep the lights on and food on the table\\nuntil things turn around, but you might stop investing, and you’ll definitely\\nstop spending budgeted “ blow money” until the rain clears. Of course, when\\nyou are just starting your Total Money Makeover, your expenses might equal\\nyour income. Later, when you are debt-free, you have all the right insurance in\\nplace, and you have large investments, you can survive on much less than\\nyour income.\\nUse All Available Cash\\nIn Baby Step Two, I instructed you to use all nonretirement savings and\\ninvestments to pay down your debt. Clean everything out and become debt-\\nfree except for the house. Use all savings and investments that don’t have a\\npenalty for withdrawal like retirement plans. If you used savings that you had\\n\\nin Baby Step Two (Start the Debt Snowball), you cleaned out even the\\nemergency fund down to Baby Step One (Save $1,000). Now is the time to\\nrebuild your emergency fund by replacing any money you may have used to\\npay debt. Many times I’ve met someone who, for example, had $6,000 in\\nsavings at the bank making 2 percent interest, and $11,000 in credit-card debt.\\nThe very thought of using $5,000 of that savings to pay the credit cards\\npartially off is very hard. That $6,000 emergency fund is your security\\nblanket, and fear rises up deep inside when someone like me mentions that\\nyou should use that money to Snowball your debt. You are right to feel that\\nfear and to question whether you should spend the $5,000 to pay down the\\ndebt. You should use that money ONLY if you and your whole family are\\ninto a Total Money Makeover. Gazelle intensity, budgeting, selling ankle-\\nweight cars, and overall total commitment to the plan are the only way using\\nthat savings makes sense.\\nYou Need All Parties Completely Onboard\\nSherry called our radio show saying that her husband wanted to use $9,000 of\\ntheir $10,000 emergency fund on Baby Step Two, but he wanted to keep his\\n$21,000 truck debt—with a household income of $43,000. Sherry was mad at\\nme for suggesting something so absurd. Of course, I didn’t make that\\nsuggestion. I think it would be a bad move for them to use $9,000 in this\\nsituation. The reason I’m against using the savings as suggested is that\\nhubby isn’t onboard. He wants to do part of the plan and keep his stupid\\ntruck. There are two reasons not to use the emergency fund in Sherry’s case.\\nFirst, hubby has not had a Total Money Makeover in his heart, and they will\\nnever make it out of debt under any strategy until he does. Second, do the\\nmath: on a $43,000 income, they will be in debt and have only a super-small\\nemergency fund for years if they keep the truck. This would be like my wife\\nsaying she wants me to lose weight and then baking homemade chocolate-\\nchip cookies every night. She would be saying one thing and doing another.\\n\\nDave Rants . . .\\nTo make more money, you have to plan to make more money. Some people’s problem\\nis income, not spending.\\nI don’t suggest you clean out your savings if everyone isn’t having a Total\\nMoney Makeover. I also don’t suggest you clean out your savings if you are\\nplanning to be in Baby Step Two (Start the Debt Snowball) for five years.\\nHowever, few of you will be in Step Two very long if you go gazelle-intense\\nand follow this plan to the letter. If your family is exposed to the elements,\\nwith only $1,000 standing between you and life for eighteen to twenty\\nmonths, that is fine. In that case, you should use your savings to become\\ndebt-free or accelerate the Snowball.\\nI know that even if everyone is onboard, gazelle-intense, and there is a plan,\\nmy suggestion still scares some of you. Good. Don’t you think one of the\\nthings that make the gazelle intense is fear? For a short period of time, while\\nyou work your Debt Snowball and rebuild your emergency fund in Step\\nThree, use that fear as a motivator to stay focused and keep everyone else\\nmoving.\\nThe good news in Sherry’s story is that her hubby heard her on the radio\\nwith me, and a lightbulb came on. He sold “ his” truck, she used “ her”\\nsavings, and in fourteen months they were debt-free; in eighteen months they\\nwere debt-free with a fully funded emergency fund. Sherry sent an e-mail to me\\nabout an amusing part of their journey. She said after they were debt-free and\\nrebuilding her precious emergency fund with the same gazelle intensity they\\nused to pay the debt, one of their teens asked them to buy a computer. Before\\nSherry could say no, her hubby grabbed the teen in a loving headlock and\\nstarted yelling, in jest, that there would be no purchases in that house until\\nthe emergency fund was done. This made Sherry smile because it told her that\\nnot only was the emergency fund coming back soon, but that her husband had\\ngotten the message of how important that fund was to her. She was willing to\\nhave a Total Money Makeover, but only if it was Total—for both of them.\\n\\nGender and Emergencies\\nThe sexes do view the emergency fund differently. In general, men are more\\ntask-oriented, and ladies are more security-based. Guys like to know what you\\n“ do,” so some of us don’t understand the idea of money just sitting there\\ncausing security. Most ladies I meet smile when we start talking about having\\n$10,000 between them and the rain. Many of them say the emergency fund\\nand life insurance are the best parts of their family’s Total Money Makeover.\\nGuys, let’s talk. God wired ladies better on this subject than He did us.\\nTheir nature causes them to gravitate toward the emergency fund. Somewhere\\ndown inside the typical lady is a “ security gland,” and when financial stress\\nenters the scene, that gland will spasm. This spasmodic gland will affect your\\nwife in ways you can’t always predict. A spasmodic security gland can affect\\nher emotions, her concentration, and even her love life. Apparently, the\\nsecurity gland is attached to her face. Can you see the financial stress on her\\nface? Believe me, guys, one of the best investments you will ever make is in\\nan emergency fund. A fully funded emergency fund and a husband in the midst\\nof a Total Money Makeover will relax the security gland and make your life\\nmuch better. My friend, Jeff Allen, a comedian, does a whole routine on\\n“ Happy Wife, Happy Life.” The bottom line is that even if you don’t “ get”\\nthe emergency fund, get one.\\nI already told you that Sharon and I lost everything, went broke, crashed,\\nand were at the bottom, so you can imagine that this subject is a little\\nsensitive at my house. Our financial crash was totally my doing: it was my\\nreal estate business screwup that Sharon watched before she took the ride with\\nme. One of the wounds in our relationship is this issue of security. Her\\nemotions can revisit the fear of looking at a brand-new baby and a toddler and\\nnot knowing how we were going to keep the heat on. That is a sensitive place\\nin her psyche, and with good reason. We don’t even use the emergency fund\\nfor emergencies. Part of the salve on that wound is that our emergency fund\\nhas an emergency fund. If I even walk near the drawer where the emergency\\nfund Money Market checkbook is kept, Sharon’s security gland can tighten\\n\\nup.\\nBeing the highly trained investment mogul that I am, I could certainly find\\nplaces to put that money where it would earn more. Or would it? Remember,\\npersonal finance is personal. I have come to realize that Sharon’s peace of\\nmind bought with the oversized emergency fund is a great return on\\ninvestment. Guys, this can be a wonderful gift to your wife.\\nAn Emergency Fund Can Turn Crises into Inconveniences\\nAs you budget over the years and your Total Money Makeover completely\\nchanges your money habits, you will use the emergency fund less and less.\\nWe haven’t touched our emergency fund in over fifteen years. When we first\\nstarted, everything was an emergency. But as you crawl off the bottom, and\\nThe Total Money Makeover begins to take effect, you have fewer things you\\ncan’t cover in your monthly budget. At the start, though, you’ll be like we\\nwere—everything will be an emergency. To show you what I mean, consider\\ntwo different stories of people at two different places in the Baby Steps.\\nKim was twenty-three, single, on her own, and at a job making $27,000\\nper year. She recently started her Total Money Makeover. She was behind on\\ncredit cards, not on a budget, and barely making her rent because her spending\\nwas out of control. She let her car insurance drop because she “ couldn’t afford\\nit.” She did her first budget and two days later was in a car wreck. Since it\\nwasn’t bad, the damage to the other guy’s car was only about $550. As Kim\\nlooked at me through panicked tears, that $550 might as well have been\\n$55,000. She hadn’t even started Baby Step One. She was trying to get\\ncurrent, and now she had one more hurdle to clear before she even started.\\nThis was a huge emergency.\\nSeven years ago, George and Sally were in the same place. They were broke\\nwith new babies, and George’s career was sputtering. George and Sally fought\\nand scraped through a Total Money Makeover. Today they are debt-free, even\\ntheir $85,000 home. They have a $12,000 emergency fund, retirement in Roth\\n\\nIRAs, and even the kids’ college is funded. George has grown personally, his\\ncareer has blossomed, and he now makes $75,000 per year while Sally stays\\nhome with the kids. One day, a piece of trash flew out of the back of George’s\\npickup and hit a car behind him on the interstate. The damage was about\\n$550.\\nI think you can see that George and Sally will probably adjust one month’s\\nbudget and pay the repairs while Kim will deal with her wreck for months.\\nThe point is that as you get in better shape, it takes a lot more to rock your\\nworld. When the accidents occurred, George’s heart rate didn’t even change,\\nbut Kim needed a Valium sandwich to calm down.\\nThose true stories illustrate the fact that as you progress through your Total\\nMoney Makeover, the definition of an emergency that is worthy to be covered\\nby the emergency fund changes. As you have better health insurance,\\ndisability insurance, more room in your budget, and better cars, you will have\\nfewer things that qualify as emergency-fund emergencies.\\nWhat used to be a huge, life-altering event will become a mere\\ninconvenience. When you are debt-free and aggressively investing to become\\nwealthy, taking a few months off from investing will put a new engine in a\\ncar. When I say the emergency fund is Murphy-repellent, that is only partially\\ncorrect. The reality is that Murphy doesn’t visit as much, but when he does\\nwe hardly notice his presence. When Sharon and I were broke, our heating-\\nand-air system quit, and the repair cost $580. It was a huge, hairy deal.\\nRecently I had a new $570 water heater installed because the old one started\\nleaking, and I hardly noticed. I wonder if the stress relief that your Total\\nMoney Makeover provides will allow you to live longer?\\nWhat used to be a huge, life-altering event will become a mere inconvenience.\\nLet Me Be Perfectly Clear\\nThere are some Baby Step Three clarifications. Joe asked recently if he should\\n\\nstop his Snowball—Step Two—to get his emergency fund finished. Joe and\\nhis wife have twins due in six months. Brad’s plant is closing in four\\nmonths, and he will lose his job. Mike got a huge severance check of $25,000\\nlast week when his company downsized him. Should these people work on\\ndebt or finish the emergency fund? All three should temporarily stop\\nSnowballing and concentrate on the emergency fund because we can see\\ndistant storm clouds that are real. Once the storm passes, they can resume the\\nplan as before.\\nResuming the plan for Joe means that once the babies are born healthy, are\\nhome, and everyone is fine, Joe will take the emergency fund back down to\\n$1,000 by using the rest of the savings to pay the Debt Snowball. Resuming\\nfor Brad would mean that once he finds his new job, he’ll do the same. Mike\\nshould hold his instant emergency fund of $25,000 until he is reemployed.\\nThe sooner he can get a job, the more that severance is going to look like a\\nbonus and have a huge impact on the Debt Snowball.\\nSometimes people think they don’t need an emergency fund because their\\nincome is guaranteed. Richard is retired from the military and receives over\\n$2,000 per month, which he could live on if he lost his job. He didn’t think\\nhe needed an emergency fund because he thought all emergencies were job-\\nrelated. Then he had a car wreck the same month he was laid off. His $2,000\\nkept coming, but now he faced car debt. Even if your income is guaranteed,\\nyou still might need to help a sick relative, replace your heating system in the\\nmiddle of winter, or get a new transmission. Large, out-of-budget emergencies\\nthat aren’t job-related do come up and will require the emergency fund.\\nIf You Don’t Own a Home\\nI keep saying that you are debt-free except for the house at this point and\\nsaving to finish the emergency fund. What if you don’t have a home yet?\\nWhen do you save for the down payment? I am going to talk as many of you\\nas possible into the 100 percent down plan, but I know some of you will take\\n\\nthe fifteen-year fixed-rate mortgage that I said earlier is okay.\\nI love real estate, but do not buy a home until you finish this step. A home\\nis a blessing, but if you move into home ownership with debt and no\\nemergency fund, Murphy will set up residence in the spare bedroom. I believe\\nin the financial and emotional advantages of home ownership, but I have\\nknown many stressed-out young couples who rushed to buy something before\\nthey were ready.\\nMyths vs.Truth\\nMyth: That collector was so helpful; he really likes me.\\nTruth: Collectors are not your friends.\\nSaving for a down payment or cash purchase of a home should occur after\\nbecoming debt-free in Step Two and after finishing the emergency fund in Step\\nThree. That makes saving for a down payment Baby Step Three (b). You\\nshould save for the home if you have the itch before moving on to the next\\nstep. Many people are worried about getting a home, but please let it be a\\nblessing rather than a curse. It will be a curse if you buy something while you\\nare still broke. There are all sorts of folks who are eager to “ work with you”\\nso you can make it happen sooner, but the definition of “ Creative Financing”\\nis “ Too Broke to Buy a House.”\\nNext Stop: Serious Wealth Building\\nWell, you have made it.

Harold Fisher was\\nfinancially secure and able to do what he wanted, and that defines retirement\\nThe Total Money Makeover way.\\nIf you hate your career path, change it.\\nWhen I speak of retirement, I think of security. Security means choices.\\n(That’s why I think retirement means that work is an option.) You can choose\\nto write a book, to design churches, or to spend time with your grandkids.\\nYou need to reach the point where your money works harder than you do. A\\nTotal Money Makeover retirement plan means investing with the goal of\\nsecurity. You already possess the ability to quit your job, and if you don’t\\nlike your work, you should consider doing that. If not today, develop a five-\\nyear game plan for transitioning into what God designed you to do; however,\\ndon’t wait till you’re sixty-five to do what you love.\\nThat said, the money part does matter. You want to reach your golden\\nyears with financial dignity. That will happen only with a plan. According to\\na study by Bankrate.com, more than 70 percent of Americans do not believe\\nthey will be able to retire with dignity. Not only have we not done anything\\nabout retiring with dignity, we have lost hope that it is even possible.\\nConsumer Federation of America found that of people making less than\\n\\n$35,000 per year, 40 percent said the best way for them to have $500,000 at\\nretirement age is to win the Lotto. Wow! These people need a Total Money\\nMakeover in a big way! If you want another peek at the warped view of reality\\nwe have, consider that Wealth Builder magazine’s poll found 80 percent of\\nAmericans believe their standard of living will go up at retirement. Talk about\\nliving in a fantasy!\\nI grew up poor, so I know the value of a dollar. My grandma raised me, and I watched her\\nstruggle every day to provide for us. She taught me early on how important it was to save\\nfor a rainy day.\\nMy first job was picking cotton. Eventually, I got a job working for a natural gas\\npipeline, and I worked for that company for 35 years. I never made more than $60,000 in\\nany given year, but I always put 10% of my check into a stock purchase plan, which is\\nwhat we used to have instead of a 401(k). At first, I didn’t think I could afford to put that\\nmuch of my paycheck into a retirement plan, but then I figured that, in the long run, I\\ncouldn’t afford not to.\\nAfter 35 years on the job, I was able to retire at age 58—seven years early—with about\\n$1,000,000 in my retirement accounts! Since retiring, I built myself a workshop and spend\\na lot of time tinkering in it, just having fun. My wife and I even took a month-long vacation\\nout west—just because it’s something we’ve always wanted to do, and we had the money to\\ndo it!\\n\\nSince we were focused on putting a little money away every month instead of keeping\\nup with the Joneses, we’re now free to do whatever we want for the rest of our lives!\\nJim (age 64) and Kay (age 60) \\nRobinson \\nBoth retired. Jim was a \\ntechnical specialist for a natural \\ngas pipeline, and Kay was a \\nnurse and stay-at-home mom\\nThe reality is much colder. USA Today reports that out of one hundred\\npeople age sixty-five, ninety-seven of them can’t write a check for $600, fifty-\\nfour are still working, and three are financially secure. Bankruptcies among\\nthose sixty-five and older went up 244 percent in a ten-year period. Getting\\nolder is going to happen! You must invest now if you want to spend your\\ngolden years in dignity. Investing with the long-term goal of security is not a\\ntheory to ponder every few years; it is a necessity you must act on now. You\\nmust actually fill out the paperwork for your mutual fund. You must actually\\nput money in that thing. According to these statistics, the level of denial the\\naverage person has on this subject is alarming.\\nBaby Step Four: \\nInvest 15 Percent of Your Income in Retirement\\nThose of you concerned about retirement are relieved we have finally gotten to\\nthis step. Those who have been living in denial are wondering what all the\\nfuss is about. Baby Step Four is time to get really serious about your wealth\\nbuilding. Remember, when you reach this step you don’t have any payments\\nbut a house payment, and you have three to six months’ worth of expenses in\\nsavings, which is thousands of dollars. With only one payment, it should be\\neasy to invest heavily. Even with a below-average income, you can ensure\\nyour golden years will have dignity. Before this step, you have ceased or have\\nnever started investing, and now you have to really pour on the coals.\\n\\nDum Math & Stupid Tax\\nA Doubly-Wide Financial Loss\\nIf you buy a $25,000 double-wide home, in five years you will owe $22,000 on a trailer\\nworth $8,000. Financially, it’s like living in your new car. I’m not above living in a mobile\\nhome (I’ve lived in worse), but they are lousy places to put money.\\nGazelle intensity in the previous steps has allowed you to be able to focus\\non growing a sizable nest egg. The tens of thousands of people we have met\\nhave helped me develop the 15 percent rule. The rule is simple: Invest 15\\npercent of before-tax gross income annually toward retirement. Why not more?\\nYou need some of your income left to do the next two steps, college saving\\nand paying off your home early. Why not less? Some people want to invest\\nless or none so they can get a child through school or pay off the home super-\\nfast. I don’t recommend that because those kids’ college degrees won’t feed\\nyou at retirement. I don’t recommend paying off the house first because I have\\ncounseled too many seventy-five-year-olds with a paid-for house and no\\nmoney. They end up selling the family home or mortgaging it to eat. Bad\\nplan. You need some retirement investing at this stage before saving for\\ncollege and the mortgage payoff. Plus, by getting started now, the magic of\\ncompound interest will work for you.\\nWhen calculating your 15 percent, don’t include company matches in your\\nplan. Invest 15 percent of your gross income. If your company matches some\\nor part of your contribution, you can consider it gravy. Remember, this is a\\nrule of thumb, so if you cheat down to 12 percent or up to 17 percent, that is\\nnot a huge problem, but understand the dangers of straying far from 15\\npercent. If you underinvest, you will one day be buying that classic cookbook,\\n72 Ways to Prepare Alpo and Love It. If you overinvest, you will keep your\\nhome mortgage too long, which will hold back the wealth-building power of\\nyour Total Money Makeover.\\nBy the same token, do not use your potential Social Security benefits in\\n\\nyour calculations. I don’t count on an inept government for my dignity at\\nretirement, and you shouldn’t either. A recent survey said more people under\\nage thirty believe in flying saucers than believe they will receive a dime from\\nSocial Insecurity. I tend to agree. I’m not taking a political position (although\\nI’m not above it), but the mathematics of that system spell doom. I’m not\\nChicken Little predicting the sky is falling; entire books have been written on\\nthe Social Security mess. Understand, it is your job to take care of you and\\nyours, so part of your Total Money Makeover is to invest now to make that\\nhappen. If Social Security isn’t there when you retire, you’ll be glad you\\nlistened to my advice. If by some miracle Social Security is there when you\\nretire, that will mean I was wrong. In that case, you’ll have some extra money\\nto give away. I’m sure you’ll forgive me for that.\\nIt is your job to take care of you and yours.\\nYour Tool Is Mutual Funds\\nNow that you have reached this step, you need to learn about mutual funds.\\nThe stock market has averaged just below a 12 percent return on investment\\nthroughout its history. Growth-stock mutual funds are what I recommend\\ninvesting in for the long term. Growth-stock mutual funds are lousy short-\\nterm investments because they go up and down in value, but they are\\nexcellent long-term investments when leaving the money longer than five\\nyears. Ibbotson Research says that 97 percent of the five-year periods and 100\\npercent of the fifteen-year periods in the stock market’s history have made\\nmoney. The Total Money Makeover is not an investment textbook, so if you\\nneed more detailed information, check out our class, Financial Peace\\nUniversity, or my first book, Financial Peace. My personal retirement funds\\nand my kids’ college funds are invested the way I teach in the The Total\\nMoney Makeover.\\nHere’s a Reader’s Digest version of my approach. I select mutual funds that\\nhave had a good track record of winning for more than five years, preferably for\\n\\nmore than ten years. I don’t look at their one-year or three-year track records\\nbecause I think long-term. I spread my retirement, investing evenly across four\\ntypes of funds. Growth and Income funds get 25 percent of my investment.\\n(They are sometimes called Large Cap or Blue Chip funds.) Growth funds get\\n25 percent of my investment. (They are sometimes called Mid Cap or Equity\\nfunds; an S&P Index fund would also qualify.) International funds get 25\\npercent of my investment. (They are sometimes called Foreign or Overseas\\nfunds.) Aggressive Growth funds get the last 25 percent of my investment.\\n(They are sometimes called Small Cap or Emerging Market funds.) For a full\\ndiscussion of what mutual funds are and why I use this mix, go to\\ndaveramsey.com and visit MyTotalMoneyMakeover.com.\\nDave Rants ...\\nThe reason you are afraid of investing is because you do not know what you are getting\\ninto. Learn about investments.\\nThe invested 15 percent of your income should take advantage of all the\\nmatching and tax advantages available to you. Again, our purpose here is not\\nto teach the detailed differences in every retirement plan out there (see my\\nother materials for that), but let me give you some guidelines on where to\\ninvest first. Always start where you have a match. When your company will\\ngive you free money, take it. If your 401k matches the first 3 percent, the 3\\npercent you put in will be the first 3 percent of your 15 percent invested. If\\nyou don’t have a match, or after you have invested through the match, you\\nshould next fund Roth IRAs.\\nThe Roth IRA will allow you to invest up to $5,000 per year, per person.\\nThere are some limitations as to income and situation, but most people can\\ninvest in a Roth IRA. The Roth grows tax-FREE. If you invest $3,000 per\\nyear from age thirty-five to age sixty-five, and your mutual funds average 12\\npercent, you will have $873,000 tax-FREE at age sixty-five. You have\\ninvested only $90,000 (30 years x 3,000); the rest is growth, and you pay no\\n\\ntaxes. The Roth IRA is a very important tool in virtually anyone’s Total\\nMoney Makeover.\\nStart with any match you can get, and then fully fund Roth IRAs. Be sure\\nthe total you are putting in is 15 percent of your total household gross\\nincome. If not, go back to 401ks, 403bs, 457s, or SEPPs (for the self-\\nemployed), and invest enough so that the total invested is 15 percent of your\\ngross annual pay.\\nExample:\\nHousehold Income $81,000\\nHusband $45,000\\nWife $36,000\\nHusband’s 401k matches first 3%.\\n3% of 45,000 ($1,350) goes into the 401k.\\nTwo Roth IRAs are next, totaling $10,000.\\nThe goal is 15% of 81,000, which is $12,150.\\nYou have $11,350 going in. So you bump the \\nhusband’s 401k to 5%, making the total invested $12,250.\\nWhat It Will Take to Retire\\nHow much do you need to retire with dignity and security? How long will it\\ntake you to get there? See the following pages for worksheets to help you\\ncalculate some of these actual numbers. You are secure and will leave a nice\\ninheritance when you can live off of 8 percent of your nest egg per year. If you\\nmake 12 percent on your money average and inflation steals 4 percent, 8\\npercent is a dream number. If you make 12 percent and only pull out 8\\n\\npercent, you grow your nest egg by 4 percent per year. That 4 percent keeps\\nyour nest egg, and therefore your income, ahead of inflation ’til death do you\\npart. You get a cost-of-living raise from your nest egg every year. If you can\\nlive with dignity on $40,000, you need a nest egg of only $500,000. I would\\nrecommend that you have the largest nest egg possible because there are some\\nreally cool non-greedy things to do with it later, like giving it away.\\nIf, when you run the calculations on the worksheet, you are afraid you\\nwon’t make your goal of saving 15 percent, keep in mind that this is just\\nBaby Step Four. Later steps will allow you to accelerate your investing while\\nstill having a life.\\nWould you dream with me for a moment? Dream that a twenty-seven-year-\\nold couple with average to below-average income commit to a Total Money\\nMakeover. They get gazelle-intense, and in three years, by age thirty, they are\\nat Step Four. They invest 15 percent of their income in four types of growth-\\nstock mutual funds with five- to ten-year track records. The average household\\nincome in America is $50,233 per year, according to the Census Bureau. Joe\\nand Suzy Average would invest $7,500 (15 percent) per year or $625 per\\nmonth. If you make $50,000 per year and have no payments except the house\\nmortgage and live on a budget, can you invest $625 per month? Follow me\\nhere. If Joe and Suzy invest $625 per month with no match into Roth IRAs\\nfrom age thirty to age seventy, they will have $7,588,545 tax-FREE! That is\\nalmost $8 million. What if I’m half wrong? What if you end up with only $4\\nmillion? What if I’m six times wrong? Sure beats the 97 out of 100 sixty-\\nfive-year-olds who can’t write a check for $600!\\nMonthly Retirement Planning\\nIn order to retire with some security, you must aim at something.

There is no excuse to retire without financial\\ndignity in the United States today.

Gayle\\nwasn’t twenty-seven like Joe and Suzy. She was fifty-seven years old, but\\nwith her attitude you would have thought this lady was 107. Harold Fisher\\nhad a much better outlook at age one hundred than Gayle did at age fifty-\\nseven. Life had dealt her some blows and had knocked most of the hope out of\\nher. A Total Money Makeover is not a magic show. You start where you are,\\nand you do the steps. These steps work if you are twenty-seven or fifty-seven,\\nand they don’t change. Gayle might be starting the retirement investing step\\nat sixty that Joe and Suzy start at thirty years old. Gayle is unwise to enter\\nher sixties without an emergency fund and with credit-card debt and a car\\npayment. She, like all of us, can’t save when she has debt and no umbrella for\\nwhen it rains. Would it have been better for Gayle to start when she was\\ntwenty-seven or even forty-seven? Obviously. But once she’s done with the\\npity party, she still needs to start with Baby Step One and follow The Total\\nMoney Makeover step-by-step to put herself in the best position possible.\\nIt is never too late to start. George Burns won his first Oscar at eighty.\\nGolda Meir was prime minister of Israel at seventy-one. Michelangelo painted\\nthe back wall of the Sistine Chapel at sixty-six. Colonel Sanders never fried\\nany chicken for money until he was sixty-five, and Kentucky Fried Chicken is\\na household name worldwide. Albert Schweitzer was still performing surgery\\nin Africa at eighty-nine. It is never too late to start. The past has passed. Start\\nwhere you are, because that is your only option. However, a note to all of you\\n\\nunder forty: All of us over forty are giving you a collective yell, “ INVEST\\nNOW!”\\nIt is never too late to start.\\nBaby Step Four is not “ Get rich quick.” The investing you do\\nsystematically and consistently over time will make you wealthy. If you play\\nwith this by jumping in and out, always finding something more important\\nthan investing, you are doomed to being one of those fifty-four out of one\\nhundred sixty-five-year-olds still working because you have to work.\\nSystematic, consistent investing is the tortoise that beats the hare in the race.\\nWhen you keep at it, the investing compounds and explodes. The following\\nby Timothy Gallway always reminds me of this concept:\\nWhen we plant a rose seed in the earth, we notice it is small, but we do not criticize it as\\n“rootless and stemless.” We treat it as a seed, giving it the water and nourishment\\nrequired of a seed.\\nWhen it first shoots up out of the earth, we don’t condemn it as immature and\\nunderdeveloped; we do not criticize the buds for not being open when they appear. We\\nstand in wonder at the process taking place, and give the plant the care it needs at each\\nstage of its development.\\nThe rose is a rose from the time it is a seed to the time it dies. Within it, at all times, it\\ncontains its whole potential. It seems to be constantly in the process of change: Yet at\\neach state, at each moment, it is perfectly all right as it is.\\nA flower is not better when it blooms than when it is merely a bud; at each stage it is\\nthe same thing . . . a flower in the process of expressing its potential.\\nThe story of the rose is about human potential and about not being defined\\nby what you do, but rather by who you are. Your Total Money Makeover and\\nthe stage your investments are in are similar. Push with gazelle intensity to\\nbloom, but know that as long as you take the progressive steps, you are\\nwinning. Ultimately, we are not defined by wealth; however, your Total\\n\\nMoney Makeover will affect your wealth, as well as your emotions,\\nrelationships, and spiritual condition. This is a “ Total” process.\\nI started listening to Dave a little under two years ago, and in that time we have become\\ncompletely debt-free with the exception of our house! We have a fully funded emergency\\nfund. We have two very nice vehicles, both of which are completely paid for. And, as we\\nkeep paying double toward our monthly mortgage bills, we will have our house paid off in\\nabout five years. The amazing thing is, we’re only in our mid-twenties!\\nI first got into debt before my wife and I were married. I just thought you were supposed\\nto finance cars, and that’s what I did. You can’t have a car without a loan, right? At one\\npoint I was working three jobs to pay off our debt. I think the bank was wondering what in\\nthe world was going on when my car payments started coming in triple the required\\namount!\\nOnce we had our entire consumer debt paid off and our emergency fund, we started\\ninvesting. We used Dave’s advice from The Total Money Makeover to invest. We have\\nour mutual funds spread out into the four different types of funds Dave talks about—Growth\\nand Income funds, Growth funds, International funds, and Aggressive Growth funds.\\nThanks to Dave, our future looks very bright. If we don’t earn and invest more annually\\n\\nthan we are right now for the rest of our lives, we will still be able to retire at age sixty-five\\nwith $12 million!\\nIt feels so good to be so young and have such financial freedom and the ability to bless\\nother people financially. Thanks, Dave, for your financial insight and more importantly for\\ncontinuing to give hope to hundreds of thousands of people.\\nAdam (age 24) and \\nKristi (age 22) Ivey \\nWorship Pastor; \\nLabor-and-Delivery Nurse.\\nAfter completing this step, you have no debt, except the house, around\\n$10,000 cash for emergencies, and you are taking steps to make sure you will\\nretire with dignity. I think I see a smile broadening. I know when Sharon and\\nI reached this step, things started to move in our lives. We started to regain\\nthe confidence that losing everything had taken from us. You are going to\\nwin. Can you feel it? Can you see it? If not, go back and read that sentence\\nagain. Better yet, write it where you’ll see it every day: “ I am going to win!”\\nYour life is changing! This is fun! Now, let’s take another step.\\nYou are going to win.\\n\\n10 \\nCollege Funding: \\nMake Sure the Kids Are Fit Too\\n \\nTime to do something about the ever-famous college fund. Many of you have\\nbeen wringing your hands while we walked through four Baby Steps and have\\nnot saved so much as a dime for those little cherubs. Some people in our\\nculture have lost their minds about college education. College is important,\\nso important that I’ve explained to my kids that if they don’t go to college,\\nwe will hire people to do mean things to them until they go. Seriously, a\\nsolid education to begin your adult life and your career will add to the quality\\nof both. I also attended and graduated from college; go figure.\\n \\nUnderstand the Purpose of a College Education \\nBefore You Fund It\\n \\nI have done financial counseling for parents whom I was afraid would need\\nyears of therapy if they didn’t provide their children the most expensive\\nschool, free for the taking. I am sure that as we start this Baby Step, we need\\nto examine our culture’s value system on the college issue. We have sold our\\nyoung people so hard and so long on college that we have begun to accept\\nsome myths about college degrees. College degrees do not ensure jobs.\\nCollege degrees certainly don’t ensure success. College degrees do not ensure\\nwealth. College degrees only prove that someone has successfully passed a\\nseries of tests. We all know college-educated people who are broke and\\nunemployed. They are very disillusioned because they thought they had\\nbought a ticket and yet were denied a seat on the train to success.\\n \\nIf you are sending your kids to college because you want them to be\\nguaranteed a job, success, or wealth, you will be dramatically let down. In\\n\\nsome cases, the letdown won’t take long because as soon as they graduate\\nthey will move back in with you. Hear me on this: college is great, but don’t\\nexpect too much from that degree. What if we were to admit that, in most\\ncases, college can only teach knowledge? If we did, we’d see that failure and\\nheartache are guaranteed—if we expect a college degree by itself to deliver\\nlife’s treasures. Only if you mix knowledge with attitude, character,\\nperseverance, vision, diligence, and extreme levels of work will your college\\ndegree produce for you. We have placed a dangerous responsibility on that\\nthin little sheepskin. We have asked that it do things it cannot do.\\nCollege degrees do not ensure wealth.\\nBecause we have turned a college degree into some kind of “ genie in a\\nbottle” formula to help us magically win at life, we go to amazingly stupid\\nextremes to get one. I have been a millionaire starting with nothing two times\\nbefore I was forty, and I attribute 15 percent of that to college knowledge and 0\\npercent to the degree. The book Emotional Intelligence reported a similar\\nfinding. In studying successful people, the author discovered that 15 percent of\\nsuccess could be attributed to training and education, while 85 percent was\\nattributed to attitude, perseverance, diligence, and vision. If we admit out loud\\nthat education is for knowledge, which is only part of the formula to success,\\nthen we don’t have to lose our minds in pursuit of the Holy Grail degree.\\nWhat about those lifelong friends your children will make in college who\\ncan “ help” them when they graduate? Let me ask you: have you made any\\nextra money because of friendships you made in college? I’m not saying\\nfriendships don’t matter, or even that college friends won’t ever help you in\\nyour career; however, if the price for those kinds of friendships is major debt,\\nit’s way too high. Besides, you can build quality relationships for the future\\nno matter where you attend school.\\nMyths vs.Truth\\n\\nMyth: Leasing a car is what sophisticated people do. You should lease things that go\\ndown in value and take the tax advantage.\\nTruth: Consumer advocates, noted experts, and a good calculator will confirm that the\\ncar lease is the most expensive way to operate a vehicle.\\nWe need this foundation of why we want college for our kids in order to set\\ngoals for school. In other words, if you do not expect quite as much from the\\ndegree, maybe you won’t break all the branches in your family tree getting the\\nkids into a college you frankly can’t afford. Again, college is important— very\\nimportant—but it is not the answer to all your kids’ problems. I will be so\\nbold as to say college isn’t even a need; it is a want. It isn’t a necessity; it is\\na luxury. This luxury is one of the first on my list, but not before retirement,\\nnot before an emergency fund, and certainly not as a reason to go into debt.\\nDave’s Rules for College\\nDo some research on the cost of attending college. Find out what your old\\ncollege costs today. Find out what the big state school in your area costs.\\nFind out what the smaller state school in your neighborhood costs. Find out\\nwhat the private, smaller, more intimate college costs. Compare them. In\\nsome areas of study and in a very few careers, where you graduate from will\\nmatter, but in most it won’t. Pedigree means less and less in our work culture\\ntoday. How can you justify going into debt $75,000 for a degree when you\\ncould have gone to a state school and paid for it out of your pocket debt-free?\\nYou can’t. If you have the $75,000 extra cash or a free-ride scholarship and\\nwant to go to that private school debt-free, by all means, do it. Otherwise,\\nreconsider.\\nThe first rule of college (whether for you or for your children) is: pay cash.\\nThe second rule is: if you have the cash or the scholarship, go. A couple of\\nyears ago, I met with the dean of the college of business from the university\\nwhere I graduated. At that time, the average college student graduated with\\n\\nabout $15,000 in student-loan debt after spending three of four years in an\\napartment, not the dorm, and eating off-campus, not on the meal plan. The\\naverage student paid $5,000 more per year to live and eat off-campus than to\\nlive in the dorm and eat cafeteria food. The student loans that they “ had to\\nhave” or they wouldn’t be able to go to college weren’t for college at all. The\\nstudent loans, on average, paid for an off-campus standard of living, and no\\ndebt was needed to get the degree, only to look good while getting the degree.\\nStay away from loans; make plans to avoid borrowing.\\nStudent loans are a cancer. Once you have them, you can’t get rid of them.\\nThey are like an unwelcome relative who comes to stay for a “ few days” and\\nis still in the guest room ten years later. We have spread the myth that you\\ncan’t be a student without a loan. Not true! According to FinAid.org, 70\\npercent of students borrow money for school expenses. Student loans have\\nbecome normal, and normal is broke. Stay away from loans; make plans to\\navoid borrowing.\\nIf you’ve planned your savings goals and don’t have much room in the\\nbudget for college, don’t panic. Knowledge is just part of the formula to\\nsuccess. With what you are able to save, those precious kids can probably get\\na good degree if they will suffer through lifestyle adjustments and get a job\\nwhile in school. Work is good for them. In past generations, students lived\\nwith relatives, slept in dorms, ate cafeteria food, and endured other hardships\\nto get a degree. They even went to schools without pedigrees to get the\\nknowledge, which is what they were after. They also were under no illusions\\nof the degree giving them guaranteed jobs or success.\\nNow, after spending pages harping on mind-set, we can set some\\nreasonable, attainable goals for saving for college.\\nBaby Step Five: \\nSave for College\\n\\nVirtually everyone thinks that saving for college is important; however, hardly\\nanyone saves money for their kids’ college education. Money magazine and\\nCBS Market Watch both quote the alarming statistic that 39 percent of\\nAmericans with kids don’t save a dime toward college. According to a 2008\\nstudy by SallieMae and Gallup, only 9 percent of families use college savings\\nfunds like ESAs and 529 plans. That means 91 percent have saved nothing or\\nclose to nothing! Why are we doing so badly? Because we are in debt, have\\nno emergency savings, no budget, and so on. We have to Baby-Step our way\\nhere in our Total Money Makeover before we have the money to save for\\ncollege. If you save for college and don’t have an emergency fund, you will\\nraid the college fund to keep the home out of foreclosure when you get laid off.\\nIf you try to save for college while making payments on everything under the\\nsun, you won’t have any money to save. On the other hand, by the time you\\nget here in the Baby Steps, you’ll have a strong foundation and money to\\nsave. If you don’t have children, or your kids are grown and gone, you will\\nsimply skip this step. For everyone else, a college fund is a necessity. And, if\\nyou do what I say, when you do start a college fund, you won’t end up\\nraiding it.\\nDum Math & Stupid Tax\\nVery Interest-ing!\\nIf your mortgage payment is $900 and the interest portion is $830, you will pay that year\\naround $10,000 in interest. What a great tax deduction! Right? Otherwise, you’d pay\\n$3,000 in taxes on that $10,000. But who in their right mind would choose to trade $10,000\\nfor $3,000?\\n\\nWhen we first started looking at college options for our daughter, we got really worried.\\nWe always lived within our means, but we never saved for the future. We’ve heard of\\nstudents racking up tens of thousands of dollars in debt for college, but we didn’t want our\\ndaughter to have that burden when she finished her education.\\nWe didn’t think it was possible to pay cash for college. At first, we just thought we would\\nhelp her as much as possible with what we had, and then we’d go into debt to cover the rest\\nof the expenses.\\nWith a little research, we found that our daughter could get most of her classes done at\\na community college—and for a lot less! She drove 20 miles each way for two years and\\nwas able to live at home. Best of all, she won three different scholarships, which paid for\\nhalf of her tuition!\\nAfter two years, she graduated with an associate’s degree in art and transferred to a\\nfour-year college. She worked hard and received even more scholarships, which lowered\\nher tuition bill. We helped by paying her apartment rent and tuition, and she worked part-\\ntime to pay for books, food, and living expenses. This was an exercise in teamwork, and we\\nall stayed focused on the goal: graduating with no debt.\\n\\nWe discovered that with a little creativity and a lot of hard work, we really could pay\\ncash for our daughter’s education—and it worked! Our daughter will graduate in a few\\nmonths with no student loans!\\nCraig (age 55) Karen (age 52) \\nSeymour \\nOptician; Police Department \\nRecords\\nESAs and 529s\\nCollege tuition goes up faster than regular inflation. Inflation of goods and\\nservices averages about 4 percent per year, while tuition inflation averages\\nabout 8 percent per year. When you save for college, you have to make at least\\n8 percent per year to keep up with the increases. Baby life insurance, like\\nGerber or other Whole Life for babies to save for college, is a joke, averaging\\nless than a 2 percent return. Savings bonds won’t work either (sorry,\\nGrandma!) because they average about 5 percent. Most states now offer prepaid\\ncollege tuition. We discussed that in Chapter 4 on Money Myths, but\\nremember that when you prepay anything, you simply break even with\\ninflation on that item. If tuition goes up 8 percent a year and you prepay it,\\nyou make 8 percent on your money. That is not too bad, but keep in mind\\nthat a decent growth-stock mutual fund will average over 12 percent when\\ninvested long-term. Of course, there are worse things than prepaid tuition.\\nUSA Today reports that 37 percent of the few who actually save for college do\\nso in a simple savings account yielding less than 3 percent. That won’t get it\\ndone. I know, something’s better than nothing. But I like another adage better\\nin this case: if something’s worth doing, it’s worth doing right. Let’s do\\nBaby Step Five the right way.\\nI suggest funding college, or at least the first step of college, with an\\nEducational Savings Account (ESA), funded in a growth-stock mutual fund.\\nThe Educational Savings Account, nicknamed the Education IRA, grows tax-\\nfree when used for higher education. If you invest $2,000 a year from birth to\\nage eighteen in prepaid tuition, that would purchase about $72,000 in tuition,\\n\\nbut through an ESA in mutual funds averaging 12 percent, you would have\\n$126,000 tax-free. The ESA currently allows you to invest $2,000 per year,\\nper child, if your household income is under $220,000 per year. If you start\\ninvesting early, your child can go to virtually any college if you save $166.67\\nper month ($2,000/year). For most of you, Baby Step Five is handled if you\\nstart an ESA fully funded and your child is under eight.\\nIf your children are older, or you have aspirations of expensive schools,\\ngraduate school, or PhD programs that you pay for, you will have to save\\nmore than the ESA will allow. I would still start with the ESA if the income\\nlimits don’t keep you out. Start with the ESA because you can invest it\\nanywhere, in any fund or any mix of funds, and change it at will. It is the\\nmost flexible, and you have the most control. To do some detailed planning,\\ncheck out the worksheet on the next page. This will help you calculate how\\nmuch you need to save to hit your college goal.\\nIf you want to do more than the ESA, or your income rules you out, you\\nmay want to look at a 529 plan. These are state plans, but most allow you to\\nuse the money at any institution of higher learning, which means you can save\\nin New Hampshire’s 529 plan and go to college in Kansas. There are several\\ntypes of 529 plans, and you should stay away from most of them. The first\\ntype to become popular was the “ life phase” plan. This type of plan allows\\nthe plan administrator to control your money and move it to more\\nconservative investments as the child ages. These perform poorly (at about 8\\npercent) because they are very conservative. The next type is a “ fixed\\nportfolio” plan, which sets a fixed percentage of your investment in a group of\\nmutual funds and locks you in until you need the money. You can’t move the\\nmoney, so if you get into some stinky funds, you’re stuck with them. This\\ntype may yield better returns, but it gives you less control—still something\\nto take a pass on.\\nMonthly College Planning\\nIn order to have enough for college, you must aim at something. Your\\n\\nassignment is to determine how much per month you should be saving at\\n12% interest in order to have enough for college.\\nIf we are saving at 12%, and inflation is at 4%, then we are moving ahead of\\ninflation at a net of 8% per year.\\nStep One:\\nIn today\\'s dollars how much per year the college of your choice\\nStep Two:\\nTo achieve that college nest egg, you will save at 12%, netting 8% after\\ninflation, so we will target that college nest egg using 8%.\\n8% Factors (select the one that matches your child\\'s age)\\nCHILD\\'S AGE  YEARS TO SAVE  FACTOR\\n0\\n \\n18\\n .002083\\n2\\n \\n16\\n .002583\\n4\\n \\n14\\n .003247\\n\\n6\\n \\n12\\n .004158\\n8\\n \\n10\\n .005466\\n10\\n \\n8\\n .007470\\n12\\n \\n6\\n .010867\\n14\\n \\n4\\n .017746\\nNote: Be sure to try one or two examples if you wait 5 or 10 years to start.\\nOne of the problems with a 529 plan is that you must give up an element of\\ncontrol. The best 529 plans available, and my second choice to an ESA, is a\\n“ flexible” plan. This type of plan allows you to move your investment around\\nperiodically with a certain family of funds. A family of funds is a brand name\\nof mutual fund. You could pick from virtually any mutual fund in the\\nAmerican Funds Group or Vanguard or Fidelity. You are stuck in one brand,\\nbut you can choose the type of fund, the amount in each, and move it around\\nif you want. This is the only type of 529 I recommend.\\nRegardless of how you save for college, do it. Saving for college ensures\\nthat a legacy of debt is not passed down your family tree. Sadly, most people\\ngraduating from college right now are deeply in debt before they start their\\ncareers. If you start early or save aggressively, your child will not be one of\\nthem.\\n\\nAfter being tired and frustrated of compiling debt over several years, I was ready to free\\nmyself and start planning for a better future. My not-yet-husband, Jared, was a great\\nencourager, but it made all the difference when my sister told me about Dave. Jared and I\\nread The Total Money Makeover, attended a Live Event, and decided it was time to attack\\nour debt with gazelle intensity before we got married.\\nEach of us paid off our cars. Jared finally was able to get rid of his $36,000 in student\\nloans, and together we were able to save $9,000 for our wedding. It was nice being\\nnewlyweds with a budget and a financial plan. Once we didn’t have credit cards to tempt\\nus to make silly purchases, sticking to the budget and saving money became so much\\neasier. Also, we each allotted ourselves a certain amount of money that we could use\\nhowever we wanted. We chose to save most of it, which curbed buying things impulsively\\ntoo. Since we were making about $42,000 a year, we had to be smart with our purchases,\\nand we decided to buy used furniture and trade in my SUV for a more economical car.\\nNot living paycheck to paycheck is a great feeling. Jared and I are on the same page\\nfinancially, and we are very excited about our future. It’s a great feeling to be planning for\\nwhat’s ahead of you instead of having to pay off your past. We are currently building up\\nour emergency fund and saving up for a down payment on a house. When we finally\\ndecide where we want to settle down, it will be nice to have the money to make the\\nchange!\\nVaneesa (age 30) and \\nJared (age 28) Smith \\n\\nServer; Chef\\nGetting Creative When You Don’t Have Much Time\\nWhat if you have only a couple of years and will not be able to save much\\nbecause you started your Total Money Makeover later in life? First, revisit the\\nconcepts at the beginning of the chapter. Plan on your child attending\\nsomewhere that is cheaper, living on campus, and eating the cafeteria food.\\nKnowledge is what you are after, not a pedigree. Student loans are off-limits.\\nYou must get creative and resourceful. Have your children think of companies\\nthat might be looking to hire someone with the degree they want. Have them\\nask the company to pay their way through school while they work for them.\\nMany companies pay tuition for their “ adult” employees; just reverse it on\\nthem. Will they all say yes? Absolutely not; in fact, most will say no, but it\\nonly takes one yes, so ask often.\\nLook into companies that have work-study programs. Many companies offer\\nto pay for school and have struck tuition deals with local colleges to attract a\\nlabor force. UPS, for instance, has a program in many cities where you can\\nwork twenty hours per week sorting boxes at night, and they will pay your\\ntuition for school during the day. Plus, they tend to pay you very well for\\npart-time work. That is just one example of many. This type of program is for\\nsomeone who wants the knowledge, not to go to school just for the “ college\\nexperience,” which translates into: they want to party. If you want to go into\\ndebt to teach your kids to drink beer or for them to get a pedigree, you need\\nmore than a simple Total Money Makeover.\\nSHOCKING STATS\\n91% of families have saved nothing— or close to nothing—toward their child’s college\\neducation.\\n\\nLook into what the military has to offer. The military isn’t for everyone,\\nbut a young man who used to work for me got a free college education by\\nserving four years in the army. Honestly, he hated the army, but it was his\\nticket to school. He grew up in subsidized housing and was told all his life\\nthat college was not in his future. He just wouldn’t be denied.\\nI was at the end of my rope, robbing Peter to pay Paul. I had maxed out two credit cards\\nand had no more “wiggle room.” I knew that I couldn’t keep it up much longer.\\nI was looking at $35,000 worth of debt— and I only made $35,000 a year in income!\\nWhen my car broke down and the mechanic gave me a $1,500 estimate on repairs,\\nsomething had to give!\\nFirst, I shopped around and found a good mechanic to do the work for just $300. Then, I\\ntook a second job to pay for it.\\nSoon after, I finally decided to attack my debt once and for all. I wanted to do it fast, so\\nI got extra jobs. I spent 10 hours a day on Saturdays and Sundays cleaning rooms at a\\nfancy resort. I remember driving from my second job and crying because I didn’t want to\\nscrub toilets or make beds anymore! But I knew it would be worth it in the end.\\n\\nIt was tough, but I did it—I paid off all $35,000 in debt! I got rid of all my credit cards\\nand stopped buying useless stuff. Plus, I have an emergency fund and a new-car fund.\\nHaving a plan for my money changed my life! People made fun of me when I was working\\ntwo or three jobs at a time, but now I’m debt-free and ahead of the game!\\nShelley Hogenhout (age 31) \\nBusiness Process Improvement \\nAnalyst\\nIf full-time military service isn’t for you, check out the National Guard.\\nThey will pay you to go to boot camp one summer between high school and\\ncollege and will then pay for enough tuition and books to get you through the\\nrest of the time. Of course, you will serve your country in the National Guard.\\nTake a high-rejection, high-paying summer sales job. There are countless\\nstories of young people selling books or participating in similar programs to\\nget through school. Some of these young guerrilla-combat salespeople get\\nmore of an education in the summer trenches than they do in marketing class.\\nA friend of mine made $40,000 selling in one summer. Upon returning to\\nclass in the fall, his marketing professor gave him a C on a sales presentation\\nhe did in front of the class. My friend, being immature, asked the professor\\nwhat he made a year. After some goading, the professor admitted to an income\\nof $35,000 per year. My friend walked out and, sadly, he quit school. He will\\nbe okay, though; his income last year was over $1,200,000. I don’t tell the\\nstory to say it is good to be immature and quit school, because even he would\\ntell you he wishes he had finished. I tell that true story because it illustrates\\nthat he learned very valuable lessons about marketing while trying to pay for\\nschool. There are benefits beyond just the money awaiting the young person\\nwho works to pay for all or part of college.\\nIf you already have the student loans or don’t want to get a loan in the first\\nplace, look into the “ under-served areas” programs. The government will pay\\nfor school or pay off your student loans if you will go to work in an\\nunderserved area. These areas are typically rural or inner-city areas. Most of\\nthese programs are for law and medicine. If you are in nursing, work a few\\n\\nyears in an inner-city hospital with the less fortunate, and you will get a free\\neducation, courtesy of the federal government.\\nDave Rants ...\\nIf you get a big tax refund, you’ve just allowed the government to use your money\\ninterest-free for one year.\\nProbably my favorite method of funding school, other than saving for it, is\\nscholarships. There is a dispute as to how many scholarships go unclaimed\\nevery year. Certainly there are people on the Web who will hype you on this\\nsubject. However, legitimately there are hundreds of millions of dollars in\\nscholarships given out every year. These scholarships are not academic or\\nathletic scholarships either. They are of small-to medium-sized dollar amounts\\nfrom organizations like community clubs. The Rotary Club, the Lions Club,\\nor the Jaycees many times have $250 or $500 per year they award to some\\ngood young citizen. Some of these scholarships are based on race or sex or\\nreligion. For instance, they might be designed to help someone with Native\\nAmerican heritage get an education.\\nThe lists of these scholarships can be bought online, and there are even a\\nfew software programs you can purchase. Denise, a listener to my show, took\\nmy advice, bought one of the software programs, and worked the system. That\\nparticular software covered more than 300,000 available scholarships. She\\nwidened the database search until she had 1,000 scholarships to apply for. She\\nspent the whole summer filling out applications and writing essays. She\\nliterally applied for 1,000 scholarships. Denise was turned down by 970, but\\nshe got 30, and those 30 scholarships paid her $38,000. She went to school\\nfor free while her next-door neighbor sat and whined that no money was\\navailable for school and eventually got a student loan.\\nIf you walk your way up these Baby Steps, you can send your kids to\\nschool without debt. Even if you start late, perseverance and resourcefulness\\n\\ncan get them through school. If you want to go to college badly enough in\\nAmerica today, you can. The good news is that those of you who have a\\nTotal Money Makeover will likely not only pay for your child’s education,\\nbut also—by teaching your children to handle money, and by becoming\\nwealthy—your grandchildren can go to school debt-free.\\n\\n11 \\nPay Off the Home Mortgage: \\nBe Ultrafit\\n \\nI have a good friend who runs a lot of marathons. I sit and listen in awe to the\\nstories of all the marathons he has run. I am amazed by the dedication,\\ntraining, and pain marathoners embrace. I have personally run one full\\nmarathon, and I enjoy doing several half marathons a year, but these folks who\\ndo multiple marathons every year are some of the fittest people in the world.\\nAs you reach Baby Step Six, you reach marathoner status in the wealth-\\nbuilding world. You have run the good race, but you aren’t done.\\n \\nBruce, my marathon friend, told me (and I experienced it too) that at about\\nthe eighteen-mile mark (out of 26.2), runners begin to lock up. Some really\\nnasty things start to happen to your muscles and your mind at that point.\\nYou’re almost through the race and nothing wants you to finish. The highly\\ntrained and conditioned body starts talking to you about stopping. Big black\\nclouds of doubt enter the mentally tough and trained competitive mind. You\\nbegin to think things like, Eighteen miles is pretty good; few others could\\naccomplish that. If you aren’t really careful, “ The Good Enough” can become\\nthe enemy of “ The Best.” “ Bad” is seldom the enemy of “ The Best,” but\\nmediocrity with a dose of doubt can keep you from excellence. Finishing well\\ncan be more important than starting well.\\nIf you aren’t really careful, “The Good Enough” can become the enemy of “The Best.”\\n \\nReach for the Gold Ring\\n \\nAt this point in your Total Money Makeover, you are debt-free except for the\\nhouse, and you have three to six months of expenses ($10,000+/–) saved for\\nemergencies. At this point in your Total Money Makeover, you are putting\\n\\n15 percent of your income into retirement savings and you are investing for\\nyour kid’s college education with firm goals in sight on both. You are now\\none of the top 5 to 10 percent of Americans because you have some wealth,\\nhave a plan, and are under control. At this point in your Total Money\\nMakeover, you are in grave danger! You are in danger of settling for “ The\\nGood Enough.” You are at the eighteen-mile mark of a marathon, and now\\nthat it is time to reach for the really big gold ring, the final two Baby Steps\\ncould seem out of your reach. Let me assure you that many have been at this\\npoint. Some have stopped and regretted it; others have stayed gazelle-intense\\nlong enough to finish the race. The latter have looked and seen just one major\\nhurdle left, after which they can walk with pride among the ultra-fit who call\\nthemselves financial marathoners. They can count themselves among the elite\\nwho have finished The Total Money Makeover.\\nWe started Dave’s plan for a Total Money Makeover in 2002 with over $3,000 in a\\nhome-equity loan, credit card bills, a $30,000 mortgage, and no emergency fund or\\nsavings. We were living on about $45,000 and felt out of control. When we learned about\\nthe Baby-Step process, we knew that it was the best way out. We started working through\\nthe Baby Steps as quickly as we could, and our lives began an immediate change.\\nWe knew we had to first get on a budget and get that Debt Snowball going. The best way\\nto jump-start things was to have a garage sale. It was great! We made over $500 and paid\\n\\noff quite a few bills immediately. We continued to work and save and work some more. We\\nwere determined to beat the system and press forward. We paid off the consumer debt,\\nfully funded our emergency fund, and started investing. We were amazed with how focused\\nwe had become on getting completely out of debt.\\nBut we didn’t stop there—the ultimate challenge was to pay off the house. This was one\\nof the most challenging things I’ve ever done in my whole life. I got a second part-time job\\ncleaning offices thirty hours a week in addition to working full-time. Joe worked overtime\\nseven days a week. For five grueling months we worked harder than we ever had in our\\nentire lives, but we knew that it was worth it. And then, finally, in September of 2005 we\\nreached our goal. We paid off our house, making us completely DEBT-FREE!!!\\nIt’s unbelievable the feeling of freedom that comes when you don’t have the weight of\\npayments hanging over your head. We can now focus on saving for retirement entirely and\\nstart really living! I even got to quit my job and start my own business so I don’t have to go\\nto a dreaded J-O-B every day; I get to do what I love. Good things really do come to\\nthose who wait.\\nGod has definitely blessed us through this experience. For the first time, our future\\nplans won’t just seem like a dream, but we can make them a reality.

No payments. How would it feel to have no payments? I\\nhave said it before, and I will repeat myself until you hear me; if you invested\\nwhat you pay in monthly payments, you’d be a debt-free millionaire before\\nlong. Your largest wealth-building tool is your income; you have read that\\nover and over. Now you get to see the possibilities unfold. You have trained,\\nconditioned, and eaten right to run this marathon, so don’t quit on the\\n\\neighteenth mile! Every dollar in your budget that you can find above living,\\nretirement, and college should be used to make extra payments on your home.\\nAttack that home mortgage with gazelle intensity.\\nHow would it feel to have no payments?\\nMy family has a fabulous dog, a Chinese pug, a dog like Frank in the Men\\nin Black movies. Her name is Heaven, and when we talk to her she cocks her\\nlittle round head sideways in a questioning look as if we have lost our minds.\\nIf you heard the way we talk to the dog, you might think we really had lost\\nour minds. We have all seen the cocked-sideways look coming at us when we\\nhave said something weird, something against the culture. When I say, “ Pay\\noff the mortgage,” some of you look at this book as if I had told you to build\\nwings and fly to the moon.\\nAnytime I speak about paying off mortgages, people give me that special\\nlook. They think I’m crazy for two reasons. One, most people have lost their\\nhope, and they don’t really believe there is any chance for them. Two, most\\npeople believe all the mortgage myths that have been spread. Yes, we must\\ndispel a few more myths. There are two really big “ reasons” that keep\\nseemingly intelligent people (like me for years) from paying off mortgages, so\\nwe will start with those.\\nRemember, Beware of the Myths\\nBig Reason Number One:\\nMyth: It is wise to keep my home mortgage to get the tax deduction.\\nTruth: Tax deductions are no bargain.\\n\\nWe discussed tax-deduction math when we looked at car fleeces. Let’s\\nreview. If you have a home with a payment of around $900, and the interest\\nportion is $830 per month, you have paid around $10,000 in interest that\\nyear, which creates a tax deduction. If, instead, you have a debt-free home, you\\nwould, in fact, lose the tax deduction, so the myth says to keep your home\\nmortgaged because of tax advantages.\\nThis situation is one more opportunity to discover if your CPA can add. If\\nyou do not have a $10,000 tax deduction and you are in a 30 percent bracket,\\nyou will have to pay $3,000 in taxes on that $10,000. According to the myth,\\nwe should send $10,000 in interest to the bank so we don’t have to send\\n$3,000 in taxes to the IRS. Personally, I think I will live debt-free and not\\nmake a $10,000 trade for $3,000. However, any of you who want $3,000 of\\nyour taxes paid, just e-mail me and I will personally pay $3,000 of your taxes\\nas soon as your check for $10,000 clears into my bank account. I can add.\\nBig Reason Number Two:\\nMyth: It is wise to borrow all I can on my home (or continually\\nrefinance for cash out) because of the great interest rates; then I\\ncan invest the money.\\nTruth: You really don’t make anything when the smoke clears.\\nThis one is a little complicated, but if you follow me, you will have\\nintellectually grasped why so many people have fallen into a financial pit. The\\nmyth that I was taught in academia (I am not against higher learning, by the\\nway, as long as we are learning the truth) is to use lower-interest debt to\\ninvest in higher-return investments. Sadly, some “ Financial Planners” have\\ntold Americans to borrow on their homes at around 8 percent to invest in\\ngood growth-stock mutual funds averaging 12 percent because you make an\\n\\neasy 4 percent spread.\\nMutual funds are awesome investments, and as I have said, I personally\\nhave tons of money invested in good growth-stock mutual funds. Also, the\\nstock market has averaged around 12 percent from the beginning. Some years\\nare great and some are lousy, and we have had both in the last ten years, but\\nthe long-term average is around 12 percent. So I buy and recommend mutual\\nfunds.\\nThe problem with this myth is that the assumptions used to get to that 4\\npercent spread or profit on investing are wrong. Mythsayers, and I have been\\none, are very naïve in how they approach investing.\\nLet’s look at borrowing $100,000 on your home to invest. If you borrowed\\nat 8 percent, you would pay $8,000 in interest, and if you invested the\\n$100,000 you borrowed on your home and made 12 percent, you would make\\n$12,000 in return, netting you $4,000. Or would you? Where I live, if you\\nmake $12,000 on an investment, you will pay taxes. If you are in a 30 percent\\nbracket, you will pay $3,600 in taxes at ordinary income rates or $2,400 if\\nyou invest at capital gains rates. So you will not net $4,000, but instead $400\\nto $1,600. But we aren’t through yet.\\nIf I own the home next to you and have no debt, and you (because of your\\ninvestment adviser guy) borrowed $100,000 on your home, who has taken\\nmore risk? When the economy moves south, when there is war or rumors of\\nwar, when you get sick or have a car wreck or are downsized, you will run\\ninto major problems with a $100,000 mortgage that I will never have. So\\ndebt causes risk to increase.\\nI can prove to you that risk increases. With the drop in real estate values\\nand the slowing market in the 2008–09 recession, many people lost their\\nhomes to foreclosure. I have done in-depth, detailed research and have found\\nthat 100 percent of the foreclosed homes had a mortgage. Ha! Sadly, some of\\nthe people who lost their homes had a naïve financial planner who left risk out\\nof his formula and suggested they “ harvest” their equity. Like I said earlier,\\n“ When the tide goes out, you can tell who was skinny-dipping.”\\n\\nSince debt causes increased risk, we must mathematically factor in a\\nreduction in return if we are sophisticated investors. If you can make 12\\npercent on a mutual fund, and I try to get you to invest in a bet on the roulette\\nwheel, which will return you 500 percent, you would automatically say the\\ntwo don’t compare. Why? Risk. Common sense tells you not to compare\\nmutual funds and roulette wheel returns without adjusting the returns for risk.\\nCommon sense tells you to discount the 500 percent upside of the roulette\\nwheel because of risk. After discounting the roulette wheel for risk, you would\\nrather have the mutual fund. Good choice.\\nKnow where you are weak, and take action to make sure you don’t fall prey to the\\nweakness.\\nActually this is done in academia as well. There is a statistical measure of\\nrisk called a beta. A big beta means a big risk. Graduate-level financial people\\nwho are taught mathematical formulas to make risky investments compare\\napples to apples with safer investments after adjustment for risk. We just never\\napply that formula to a debt-free home versus a mortgaged and invested home,\\nwhich is very naïve. The technical formula is great for putting you to sleep,\\nbut understand that you can’t compare risk with no risk unless you make\\nadjustments.\\nThe bottom line is that after adjusting for taxes and risk, you don’t make\\nmoney on our little formula. Throughout a lifetime of investing and\\nmortgaging, the debt-free person will actually come out ahead.\\nMyth: Take out a thirty-year mortgage and promise yourself to pay\\nit like a fifteen-year, so if something goes wrong you have wiggle\\nroom.\\nTruth: Something will go wrong.\\nOne thing I am sure of in my Total Money Makeover: I had to quit telling\\nmyself that I had innate discipline and fabulous natural self-control. That is a\\n\\nlie. I have to put systems and programs in place that make me do smart\\nthings. Saying, “ Cross my fingers and hope to die, I promise, promise,\\npromise I will pay extra on my mortgage because I am the one human on the\\nplanet who has that kind of discipline,” is kidding yourself. A big part of\\nbeing strong financially is that you know where you are weak and take action\\nto make sure you don’t fall prey to the weakness. And we ALL are weak.\\nSick children, bad transmissions, prom dresses, high heat bills, and dog\\nvaccinations come up, and you won’t make the extra payment. Then we\\nextend the lie by saying, “ Oh, I will next month.” Grow up! The FDIC says\\nthat 97.3 percent of people don’t systematically pay extra on their mortgage.\\nShorter Terms Matter\\nPurchase Price $250,000\\nDown Payment $ 25,000\\nMortgage Amount $225,000\\nAt 7% Interest Rate\\n30 Years $1,349 $485,636\\n15 Years $1,899 $341,762\\nDifference $550 $143,874\\nFive hundred fifty dollars more per month, and you will save almost\\n$150,000 and fifteen years of bondage. The really interesting thing I have\\nobserved is that fifteen-year mortgages always pay off in fifteen years. Again,\\npart of a Total Money Makeover is putting in place systems that automate\\nsmart moves, which is what a fifteen-year mortgage is. Thirty-year mortgages\\nare for people who enjoy slavery so much they want to extend it for fifteen\\nmore years and pay thousands of dollars more for the privilege. If you must\\ntake out a mortgage, pretend only fifteen-year mortgages exist.\\n\\nIf you have a great interest rate, it is not necessary to refinance to pay a\\nmortgage off in fifteen years or earlier. Simply make payments as if you have a\\nfifteen-year mortgage, and your mortgage will pay off in fifteen years. If you\\nwant to pay any mortgage off in twelve years or any number you want, visit\\nmy Web site or get a calculator and calculate the proper payment at your\\ninterest rate on your balance for a twelve-year mortgage (or the number you\\nwant). Once you have that payment amount, add to your monthly mortgage\\npayment the difference between the new principal and interest payment and\\nyour current principal and interest payment, and you will pay off your home in\\ntwelve years.\\nThe best time to refinance is when you can save on interest. Use the\\nworksheets on the following pages to determine whether you should refinance.\\nWhen refinancing, paying points or origination fees are not in your best\\ninterest. Points or origination fees are prepaid interest. When you pay points\\nyou get a lower Annual Percentage Rate (APR) because you have already paid\\nsome of the interest up-front. The math shows that you don’t save enough on\\ninterest rates to pay yourself back for the points. When you pay points you are\\nprepaying interest, and it takes an average of about ten years to get your\\nmoney back. The Mortgage Bankers Association says the average life of a\\nmortgage is only about three to five years, so on average you don’t save\\nenough to get your money back before you pay the loan off by moving or\\nrefinancing. When refinancing, ask for a “ par” quote, which means zero points\\nand zero origination fee. The mortgage broker can make a profit by selling the\\nloan; they don’t need the origination fee to be profitable.\\nMyth: It is wise to use the lower rates offered by an ARM mortgage\\nor balloon mortgage if you know you’ll “be moving in a few\\nyears anyway.”\\nTruth: You will be moving when they foreclose.\\nThe ARM, Adjustable Rate Mortgage, was invented in the early 1980s.\\nPrior to that, those of us in the real estate business sold fixed-rate 7 or 8\\n\\npercent mortgages. What happened? I was there in the middle of that disaster\\nof an economy when fixed-rate mortgages went as high as 17 percent and the\\nreal estate world froze. Lenders paid out 12 percent on CDs but had money\\nloaned out at 7 percent on hundreds of millions of dollars in mortgages. They\\nwere losing money, and lenders don’t like to lose money. So the Adjustable\\nRate Mortgage was born, in which your interest rate goes up when the\\nprevailing market interest rates go up. The ARM was born to transfer the risk\\nof higher interest rates to you, the consumer. In the last several years, home\\nmortgage rates have been at a thirty-year low. It is not wise to get something\\nthat adjusts when you are at the bottom of rates! The mythsayers always seem\\nto want to add risk to your home, the one place you should want to make sure\\nhas stability.\\nBalloon mortgages are even worse. Balloons pop, and it is always strange\\nto me that the popping sound is so startling. Why don’t we expect it? It is in\\nthe very nature of balloons to pop. Wise financial people always move away\\nfrom risk, and the balloon mortgage creates risk nightmares. When your entire\\nmortgage is due in thirty-six or sixty months, you send out engraved\\ninvitations for Murphy (Remember him? If it can go wrong, it will) to live in\\nyour spare bedroom. I have seen hundreds of clients and callers over the years\\nlike Jill.\\nAddendum One\\nHow to Figure Your New Payment \\nMonthly Payment per $1,000 in Loan Amount\\nRate  15-Year  30-Year\\n4.5%  \\n7.65\\n 5.07\\n5.0%  \\n7.91\\n 5.37\\n5.5%  \\n8.17\\n 5.68\\n\\n6.0%  \\n8.44\\n 6.00\\n6.5%  \\n8.71\\n 6.32\\n7.0%  \\n8.99\\n 6.66\\n7.5%  \\n9.28\\n 7.00\\n8.0%  \\n9.56\\n 7.34\\n8.5%  \\n9.85\\n 7.69\\n9.0%  \\n10.15\\n 8.05\\n9.5%  \\n10.44\\n 8.41\\n10.0%  \\n10.75\\n 8.78\\n10.5%  \\n11.05\\n 9.15\\n11.0%  \\n11.37\\n 9.52\\n11.5%  \\n11.68\\n 9.90\\n12.0%  \\n12.00\\n 10.29\\nExample: Sale Price - $150,000,15 years at 6%\\n$150,000 \\\\1,000 = 150 X 8.44 (look at rate and # of years financed) =\\n$1,266 Monthly Payment\\nAddendum Two \\nShould I Refinance?\\n\\nExample: Refinance on a $150,000 mortgage\\n$1,434 current payment - $1,307 new payment = $127 savings \\n$2,300 closing cost divided by $127 savings = 18 months\\nWill you stay in your home longer than the number of months to break even?\\nIf so, you are a candidate for a refinance.\\nESTIMATED CLOSING COSTS TABLE\\nLoan Amount  Closing Costs  Loan Amount  Closing Costs\\n30,000\\n \\n1,500\\n 75,000\\n 1,850\\n35,000\\n \\n1,550\\n 80,000\\n 1,900\\n40,000\\n \\n1,600\\n 85,000\\n 1,925\\n45,000\\n \\n1,650\\n 90,000\\n 1,950\\n50,000\\n \\n1,700\\n 95,000\\n 1,975\\n55,000\\n \\n1,725\\n 100,000\\n 2,000\\n60,000\\n \\n1,775\\n 150,000\\n 2,300\\n65,000\\n \\n1,800\\n 200,000\\n 2,600\\n70,000\\n \\n1,825\\n 250,000\\n 2,900\\n\\nAddendum Three\\nHow to Figure the Change in Your ARM\\nYour Adjustable Rate Mortgage adjusts based on the movement of an index.\\nYou can find your index in your original note or mortgage. The most\\ncommonly used index is the Treasury Bill. The one-year ARM uses the one-\\nyear T-Bill, and the three-year ARM uses the three-year T-Bill, and so on.\\nOther commonly used indexes are the LIBOR and THE 11TH DISTRICT\\nCOST OF FUNDS.\\nFirst, find out what index you use and when it is adjusted.\\nNext, find out (also from your paperwork) what \"margin\" was assigned to your\\nloan (usually 2.59).\\nBasically your ARM moves as the index moves.\\nThe index is usually published daily in the Wall Street Journal.\\nSo if you have a one-year ARM that adjusts with the one-year T-Bill and a\\nmargin of 2.59 (which is typical), then at the one-year anniversary of your\\nclosing you would look up the one-year T-Bill in the Wall Street Journal.\\nAdd the T-Bill to your margin, and you have your new rate (if it is not\\ncapped).\\nExample: T-Bill 4.41 plus margin 2.59 = 7% new interest rate.\\nWarning: Almost all ARMs start below margin the first year, guaranteeing a\\npayment increase at anniversary unless rates DROP.\\nJill is the wife of a sophisticated, upwardly mobile corporate guy. Her\\nhusband assured her they would be moving up because his career was on the\\nfast track. So they got the lower interest rate and took a five-year balloon.\\n\\n“ We just knew we would move inside five years,” she said. Her husband\\nbegan having headaches in the third year of the mortgage, which, sadly, they\\ndiscovered were caused by a brain tumor. We met this upwardly mobile\\ncorporate executive with limited speech and in a wheelchair, totally and\\npermanently disabled at thirty-eight years of age. His life had been spared, but\\nthe surgeries had devastated him. Jill, now a middle-aged mom of two with a\\ndisabled husband, didn’t have the income to refinance the home when the\\nballoon came due.\\nThe bank wasn’t evil; they were just doing their job as they began\\nforeclosure. I wish I could tell you a happy ending, but the truth is, they sold\\ntheir home at a deep discount to stop the foreclosure and now rent and try to\\nsurvive. All of this happened because they tried to save a few dollars on the\\ninterest rate, “ and we knew we were going to move.” They did.\\nSHOCKING STATS\\n80% of Americans believe their standard of living will go up at retirement. Talk about\\nliving in a fantasy!\\nMyth: The home-equity loan is good to have instead of an\\nemergency fund.\\nTruth: Again, emergencies are precisely when you don’t need debt.\\nThe home-equity loan is one of the most aggressively marketed loans\\ntoday. The average American in debt to his eyeballs has exhausted all means\\nof borrowing except the big second mortgage on his home. This is very sad\\nbecause we now put our homes at risk to go on vacation, open a business,\\nconsolidate debt, or just for an emergency fund. Families come to us in dire\\nstraits when the home-equity loan is their last bad mistake and the straw that\\nbreaks the camel’s back.\\n\\nThe banking industry calls these loans HELs for short, and my experience\\ntells me they simply left off an L. These loans are very dangerous, and an\\nunbelievable amount of them end in foreclosure.\\nEven a conservative person who doesn’t have credit-card debt and pays cash\\nfor vacations can make the mistake of the HEL by setting up a loan or a “ line\\nof credit” just for emergencies. That seems reasonable until you have walked\\nthrough an emergency or two, and you realize very plainly that an emergency\\nis the last time you need to be borrowing money. If you have a car wreck or\\nlose your job and then borrow $30,000 against your home to live on while\\nyou make a comeback, you will likely lose your home. Most HELs are\\nrenewable annually, meaning they requalify you for the loan once a year.\\nEd and Sally didn’t realize this. Ed is a very sophisticated financial guy, or\\nso he thought, so he had a HEL for emergencies. Sally had a bad car wreck,\\nand within three months Ed got downsized. They quickly went through the\\nHEL and then got behind in their bills. The annual renewal came up on the\\nHEL, and the bank chose not to renew their loan because of their bad credit,\\nwhich had been perfect for the previous seventeen years of marriage. The bank\\ncalled the note. Ed couldn’t believe the bank would kick them when they\\nwere down. The note being called meant they had to refinance to pay off the\\nbank, but guess what? They couldn’t because their credit was bad. The end\\nresult was very sad; they sold their home to avoid a foreclosure. Ed was\\nwrong. They should have had an emergency fund instead of a loan.\\nMyth: You can’t pay cash for a home!\\nTruth: Bet me.\\nFirst, let me tell you that mortgage debt is the only kind of debt I don’t\\nyell about. I want you to pay off your home as a part of your Total Money\\nMakeover, and, for all the reasons stated in the previous pages, you have to be\\nvery careful. When asked about mortgages, I tell everyone never to take more\\nthan a fifteen-year fixed-rate loan, and never have a payment of over 25 percent\\n\\nof your take-home pay. That is the most you should ever borrow.\\nI don’t borrow money—ever. Luke called me from Cleveland to tell me\\nthat some of our listeners and readers are doing what Sharon and I have done,\\n“ The 100-Percent-Down Plan.” Pay cash. Most people don’t think that can\\nbe done. Luke did it.\\nPaying cash for a home is possible, very possible.\\nLuke made really good money. His income at twenty-three years old was\\n$50,000, and he married a young lady making $30,000. His grandfather had\\npreached to him never to borrow money. So Luke and his new bride lived in a\\nvery small apartment over a rich lady’s garage. They paid only $250 a month\\nfor it. They lived on nothing, did nothing that cost money, and they saved.\\nMan, did they save! Making $80,000 in the household, they saved $50,000 a\\nyear for three years and paid cash for a $150,000 home. They closed on the\\nhome on Luke’s wife’s twenty-sixth birthday. They lived like no one else,\\nand now they are living like no one else. If you make $80,000 per year and\\ndon’t have any payments, you can become very wealthy very quickly. Keep in\\nmind, though, that Luke’s friends and relatives thought he should be\\ncommitted. They made fun of his cars, his lifestyle, and his dream. Only his\\nbride and his grandfather believed in his dream. Who cares what the broke\\npeople think?\\nYou may not make $80,000 per year, but you may not need a $150,000\\nhome as your starter either. You may not make $80,000 per year, so your\\ndream might take five years instead of three, like Luke’s. Ask any eighty-year-\\nold if five years of sacrifice is worth it to change your financial destiny for the\\nrest of your life! Ask any eighty-year-old if five years of sacrifice is worth it to\\nhave the satisfaction of knowing you changed your family tree. Paying cash for\\na home is possible, very possible. What’s hard to find is people willing to\\npay the price in sacrificed lifestyle.\\n\\nBefore we got married, Doug and I had both been divorced and both had custody of our\\nchildren. As single parents, it was a struggle to afford house payments and all the other bills\\nassociated with everyday life. Every time the mortgage or rent was due, the checkbook got\\ntighter and tighter. I was trying to finish college, and he had a lot of unpaid debt from his\\nprevious marriage. I had one credit card that I found myself using for emergencies (car\\nrepairs, etc.). I didn’t believe in carrying a balance on it, but our debt was fairly\\nsubstantial when we got married.\\nShortly into our marriage, we began our Total Money Makeover. Doug listened to the\\nradio show every day during his thirty minute commute to work and was convinced of the\\nfinancial peace we could have in our future by simply following the Baby Steps. I decided\\nto get onboard with him, because we really had nothing left to lose at this point.\\nAfter we stopped using our credit cards, we spent a lot less! And establishing a budget\\nhighlighted the areas in which we had been blindly wasting our money. We realized a lot of\\nour expenses were due to eating out and various luxury items that we could live without.\\nWe decided to take every extra dollar we had and pay off our credit card. Next we paid off\\nmy car. Then, we set up our emergency fund and began working on our mortgage.\\nThankfully, we paid off the house a year and a half ahead of schedule! While so many\\npeople don’t even realize the importance and sense of fulfillment that come from owning\\nyour home, we found this to be the last and biggest step in finding true financial peace.\\nSince we’ve become debt-free, we have greatly enjoyed taking more family vacations\\nand spending time together. There is so much less stress on the entire family! It’s amazing\\n\\nhow much easier it was to bring the family closer together once we eliminated all the\\nmoney concerns we used to have. We still do not live lavishly, and we love to bargain shop\\nfor everything we buy, but the peace we have from being debt-free is worth the small\\nsacrifices! Thanks for redirecting the course our family was headed down, Dave!\\nSabrina (age 42) and \\nDoug (age 52) Howerton \\nAluminum-mill Worker; \\nRetail-Store Manager\\nA Picture of Freedom\\nWell, there it is, Baby Step Six, debt-free and loving it. Our observation of\\nfamilies who stay gazelle-intense is that they pay off the mortgage about seven\\nyears from the date they declared war on the culture, from the date they\\ndecided to have a Total Money Makeover. I’m sure by now you are reassured\\nthat this is not a get-rich-quick book. What kind of author would tell a\\nmicrowave culture that it takes an average of seven years to reach the last Baby\\nStep? What kind of author would tell a sound-bite culture that the first two\\nsteps take a very tough two or two and a half years? An author who has seen\\nit done tens of thousands of times by ordinary people with extraordinary desire\\nwould do that, the same author who tells you it’s not easy, just worth it.\\nI have used the emotional tag with radio audiences and live audiences that\\nthe grass will feel different under your feet when you own it. When you pay off\\nthe mortgage, have a barefoot mortgage-burning party and invite all your\\nfriends, relatives, and neighbors. Maybe they will catch the bug and want a\\nTotal Money Makeover when they see yours is really working.\\nWere you to visit my offices, you would find around our meeting room\\nmementos of people having a Total Money Makeover. There are lots of\\nexhibits built of destroyed and maimed credit cards sent in by people who\\nhave discovered if they will live like no one else, later they can live like no\\none else. One of the more memorable exhibits is a framed letter with a ziplock\\nbag. This letter and sample of fescue were handed to me in person in a\\nshopping mall in Louisville, Kentucky. I was there doing a radio appearance\\n\\nand book signing when up walked Alicia, or “ Al,” as she likes to be called.\\nDum Math & Stupid Tax\\nFinally, Surfing the Net Pays Off\\nThere are legitimately hundreds of millions of dollars in scholarships given out each year\\nthat are not academic or athletic based. Putting your college-bound teen to work\\nsearching for scholarships could end up paying thousands (or even tens of thousands) of\\ndollars toward college tuition. Isn’t that worth giving up TV, chat rooms, or Xbox a few\\nhours per week?\\nAccording to her letter, Al’s story was typical but didn’t end normally.\\nShe and her husband started their Total Money Makeover at age twenty-five.\\nThey listened to me on our talk radio show and decided they’d had enough.\\nThey started with $20,000 in student loans, $10,000 in car loans, $3,000 in\\ncredit-card debt, and an $85,000 mortgage; a grand total of $118,000 in debt.\\nOn a $70,000 annual household income, they paid off every red cent in six\\nyears. At thirty-one years young, Al stood before me a smiling and free\\nwoman. She brought me one of my favorite gifts too. She brought me the\\nletter and a ziplock bag. What was in the bag? Fescue from her backyard,\\n“ because,” she said, “ the grass really does feel different under my bare feet in\\nthe backyard now that there is no mortgage and we are DEBT-FREE!”\\nI asked what she was going to do now that she was debt-free. Her response\\nwas fun. She said she and her husband were going to dinner to celebrate. At\\ndinner they were going to do two things: First, read the menu from left to\\nright for a change, because money is now no object. Second, at the celebration\\ndinner they fully intended to spend more than a car payment! You see, if you\\nwill live like no one else, later you can live like no one else.\\nNext, Al said she and her husband were on a direct course to the last Baby\\nStep and would give more than they had ever imagined they would have. At\\nthirty-one, this couple is destined for extreme levels of wealth.\\n\\nCongratulations, Al. You and your husband are true examples of what a Total\\nMoney Makeover looks like.\\n\\n12 \\nBuild Wealth Like Crazy: \\nArnold Schwarzedollar, Mr. Universe of Money\\n \\nYou have reached that perfect number, Baby Step Seven.

Why did\\nyou do it? Why all the sacrifice and work? To be in debt and out of control\\ndoesn’t take nearly as much effort. Why go to all this trouble? Why do you\\nwant to have wealth? If you think wealth will answer all life’s questions and\\nmake you trouble-free, you are delusional. I have had wealth twice in my life,\\nand I don’t find it to be trouble-free; as a matter of fact, most of the troubles\\nhave zeros on them. Wealth is not an escape mechanism. It is instead a\\ntremendous responsibility. So what would you do if you had $18 million that\\nit took you forty years to acquire?\\n \\nWealth is not an escape mechanism. It is instead a tremendous responsibility.\\n\\nAfter years of studying, teaching, and even preaching on this subject across\\nAmerica, I can find only three good uses for money. Money is good for FUN.\\nMoney is good to INVEST. And money is good to GIVE. Most anything\\nelse you find to do with it doesn’t represent good mental and spiritual health\\non your part. So if you one day have $18 million, you should do all three of\\nthese things. In fact, while you are working the steps to wealth, you should be\\ndoing all three of these things. You have lost weight, you have built up your\\ncardiovascular system, and now you have added muscle because you have lost\\nthe debt, saved for emergencies, and invested long-term for retirement and\\ncollege planning. At this stage in The Total Money Makeover, you are\\nArnold Schwarzedollar, Mr. Universe of Money, with serious abs, pecs, and\\nquads.

Should anyone wear a $30,000 watch? Should\\nanyone drive a brand-new $50,000 car? Should anyone live in a $700,000\\nhome? Absolutely, they should. The problem with people is, they buy those\\nthings when they can’t afford them.\\nIn Chapter 3 on Debt Myths, we talked about new cars and what a bad\\ninvestment they are. They go down in value very rapidly. Because the new car\\nis the largest thing we buy that goes down in value, the car payment is\\nusually our largest payment, except for the home mortgage. Roughly 70\\npercent of the people I assist in a Total Money Makeover have to make the\\ndifficult decision to sell their car so they can be free of the big payment. If they\\ndon’t free themselves from this very large debt and very large payment, they\\nfind it very hard to climb the Baby Steps. So some days my talk radio show\\n\\nbecomes the “ sell the car” show. Some days it seems my answer to every\\nquestion is, “ Sell the car.” “ Don’t buy that new car,” is advice you will hear\\nfrom me so often you’ll be saying it in your sleep.\\nDum Math & Stupid Tax\\nHome Sweet Loan\\nWish to borrow $100,000 to invest? At 8%, you would pay $8,000 in interest, but if you\\nborrowed $100,000 on your home, you might earn 12% on your investment, netting you\\n$4,000. Or would you? After taxes you may only net $400 to $1,600 while putting your\\nhome in great financial risk.\\nSometimes a caller will ask if he can afford a purchase while on his Total\\nMoney Makeover. Sometimes a new listener wanders into the snare of asking\\nabout buying something totally ridiculous. I’m nice, at first, to explain that\\nshe can’t do that now. I’ll say something like, “ The emergency fund is more\\nimportant than a leather couch.” I have a computer in front of me while I’m on\\nthe air, which the phone screener uses to tell me who is on hold and what\\nthey are calling about. Not long ago I looked down at the screen and saw that\\nMichael was waiting to talk with me. The note said he wanted to buy a\\nHarley-Davidson motorcycle. Harleys are fabulous bikes, but they are not for\\nbroke people, because a nice one will cost over $20,000. I prejudged Michael\\nto be twenty-eight years old, with two car payments, two kids, one wife, and\\nno money. I figured Michael was one of those guys who puts his little-boy\\nfantasies before the good of his family. I loaded my gun to respond to his\\nquestion. I was prepared not only to tell him not to buy a Harley, but also to\\nstraighten out his whole way of looking at financial matters.\\nI figured Michael was probably making $48,000 per year and broke, so\\nobviously he had no business buying a $20,000 toy. “ Dave, I’ve always\\ndreamed of owning a Harley,” Michael started. “ I just called to see if you\\nthought I should buy one, and if I can afford it.” For a few minutes I went on\\n\\nabout how great Harleys are and how a lot of guys would love to have one. I\\nusually ask a little about the caller’s financial situation in order to make a\\nquasi-reasonable judgment, so I asked Michael what he made last year. His\\nresponse was, “ $650,000.” “ Yeah, but what have you averaged over the last\\nfive years?” I asked, thinking he maybe hit the Lotto. “ About $550,000 per\\nyear,” was his answer. Now he had me on the ropes. “ So how much do you\\nhave in investments?” I queried further. “ About $20 million,” came his final\\nblow. “ Buy the Harley, dude!” was my advice. Can Michael afford a $20,000\\ntoy? Absolutely. Is it morally wrong for him to enjoy a fun item he wants\\nwhen for him to purchase it as a percentage of his wealth is equal to most\\npeople buying a Happy Meal? No, there is absolutely nothing financially or\\nmorally wrong with that purchase. The man has earned his Harley and then\\nsome.\\nMyths vs.Truth\\nMyth: I can’t use cash because it is dangerous; I might get robbed.\\nTruth: You are being robbed every day by not using the power of cash.\\nI told you Michael’s story to make sure you understand that one reason to\\nhave a Total Money Makeover is to build wealth that allows you to have fun.\\nSo have some fun! Taking your family, even the extended ones, on a seven-\\nday cruise, buying large diamonds, or even buying a new car are things you\\ncan afford to do when you have millions of dollars. You can afford to do these\\nthings because when you do them, your money position is hardly even\\naffected. If you like travel, travel. If you like clothes, buy some. I am releasing\\nyou to have some fun with your money, because money is to be enjoyed.\\nThat guilt-free enjoyment is one of the three reasons to have a Total Money\\nMakeover.\\nHave some fun!\\n\\nInvesting Is How We Keep on Winning\\nThe grown-up inside us likes the INVESTING of money because that is part\\nof what makes you wealthy. Also, the growing dollars are a way of keeping\\nscore in our Total Money Makeover game. Are we winning? It truly becomes\\na game. In the movie Two Weeks’ Notice , Hugh Grant plays George Ward.\\nThe character of George is a very wealthy and spoiled corporate figurehead.\\nHis character isn’t one we want to imitate, but he has a great line in the\\nmovie about his wealth. He is telling Sandra Bullock’s character that he lives\\nin this luxury hotel, and he says nonchalantly, “ Actually, I own the hotel;\\nmy life is a little bit like Monopoly.”\\nInvesting can feel like that after a while—“ a little bit like Monopoly.”\\nWhen you are playing Monopoly, you can be up, or you can get behind.\\nSometimes the market fluctuates, but as mature investors we ride out the\\nwaves, stay in for the long term. Sometimes I meet people who arrive at this\\nstep and are scared because just as they reach retirement age, their investments\\nare heading down. Never fear; if you have quality investments with long-term\\ntrack records, they will come back. Besides, you don’t need all the nest egg at\\nonce to retire on; you just need some of the income from it. So since you\\ndon’t need it all right then, it would be silly to cash everything out while the\\nmarket is at the bottom. “ Buy high; sell low” is not the formula to wealth.\\nBe patient with the market while living off the income the nest egg produces.\\nSHOCKING STATS\\n19% of the people who filed for bankruptcy in 2002 were college students.\\nYou can choose to be a little more sophisticated, but until you have over\\n$10 million, I would keep your investing very simple. You can clutter your\\nlife with a bunch of unnecessary stress by getting into extremely complex\\ninvestments. I use simple mutual funds and debt-free real estate as my\\n\\ninvestment mix—very clean, simple investments with some basic tax\\nadvantages. As you arrive at this Baby Step, if you want to own some paid-for\\nreal estate, it can be fun.\\nAlways manage your own money.\\nAlways manage your own money. You should surround yourself with a\\nteam of people smarter than you, but you make the decisions. You can tell if\\nthey are smarter than you if they can explain complex issues in ways you can\\nunderstand. If a member of your team wants you to do something “ because I\\nsay so,” get a new team member. You are not hiring a daddy; you are\\ngathering counsel. God did not give them the responsibility over this money.\\nHe gave that to you. Celebrities and pro athletes often lose their entire fortunes\\nbecause they give up the responsibility of managing their own money. The\\nmoney manager who loses your hard-earned investments won’t live with the\\nregret and pain that you will. The Bible states, “ In the multitude of\\ncounselors there is safety” (Prov. 11:14 NKJV). A good estate-planning\\nattorney, a CPA or tax expert, an insurance pro, an investment pro, and a\\ngood realtor are a few of the essential team members you should gather around\\nyou. I endorse the use of financial planners if they are team members and not\\nthe sole captains of their teams.\\nWhen selecting and working with your wealth team, it is vital to bring on\\nonly members who have the heart of a teacher, not the heart of a salesman or\\nthe heart of an “ expert.” The salesman is always chasing a commission and\\nthinking short-term, and the “ expert” can’t help being condescending, which\\nis humorous because they likely have less money than you. Also, when\\ntaking advice, evaluate if the person giving the advice will profit from the\\nadvice. If your insurance pro is coming up with more great insurance ideas\\nevery week, you may have a problem. That is not to say everyone who makes\\na commission off you is out to get you. There are plenty of commission-only\\nfinancial people who have extreme levels of integrity. Just be aware of possible\\nconflicts of interest.\\n\\nAs a schoolteacher, everyone knows that the pay isn’t great. With an income of less than\\n$40,000, one adopted son, and no plans for our financial future, I knew we had to make\\nsome changes. We heard about Dave Ramsey’s plan at our church, and we were so\\ninspired that we set a goal to pay off our $50,000 mortgage in five years. We knew that to\\nhave a Total Money Makeover, vacations and fancy toys were out, and we would have to\\ntighten our budget considerably. But we were excited about what was at the finish line.\\nI started a few side businesses—tax prep and eBay—and was able to add about $15,000\\nextra income to our payment. With all of this extra income, you might think that paying off\\na $50,000 mortgage would be easy to do in five years, but our plans to adopt a little girl\\nfrom China were priority. The adoption costs were around $17,000, and just when we didn’t\\nthink we would be able to get pregnant . . . Surprise! Our health insurance did not cover\\nchildbirth, so we had an additional $5,000 added to our payments.\\nWith a growing family, we were more determined than ever to get rid of the house\\npayment. And praise the Lord! We did it in just less than four years! We beat our goal by a\\nfull year. That just proves if we can do this, anyone can.\\nNow that we are on the other side, it is so awesome. It is such a peaceful feeling to know\\n\\nthat money does not control us. Even though I am still a teacher, and my wife stays home\\nwith our kids . . . NOW we can take those vacations and buy fancy toys. PLUS we’ve\\nadopted another girl from China, making us a family of four on a teacher’s salary. We’re\\nable to give freely to people and organizations we believe in that focus on orphaned\\nchildren in China.\\nWe give like never before; we save like never before; and, most important, we live life\\nthe way God intended us to like never before.\\nKeith (age 40) and \\nKaren (age 42) McGinty \\nMath Teacher; \\nStay-at-Home Mom\\nWithin Baby Step Seven: Build Wealth, there is a Subsection B, another\\nmilestone. The second milestone within becoming wealthy is the “ Pinnacle\\nPoint.”\\nGrowing up in the suburbs in Tennessee, I grew accustomed to riding a\\nbike and facing hills. To a seven-year-old with one gear, a huge hill looked\\nlike Mount Everest. I don’t know which kid in history did it first, but the\\ntechnique for small-guy bike hill climbing has been passed down for\\ngenerations—the switchback. Instead of pedaling straight up, we would\\npainfully go side to side, taking a small bite at a time of our Tennessee\\nmountain. The unpopular players’ baseball cards made a slow click, click,\\nclick through the spokes as we made our ascent. The heat seemed ovenlike,\\nand the beads of sweat turned to rivers. This is the time a seven-year-old\\npushes with every muscle in his being. The strain and determination show on\\nyour face like last year’s Halloween mask. You pull on the handlebars with all\\nthe power your arm muscles will produce to push your legs down on the\\npedals one more time. Push, push, breathe, breathe—until you finally reach\\nthe top.\\nWhat do you find at the top? The cynical among us just said, “ Another\\nhill to climb.” Those of us with a kid still alive inside know what was at the\\ntop. Those of us who still have a kid inside who can dream, who can believe,\\nand who can hope know what we found at the top. Those of us who have\\n\\npushed up some unbelievable hills know what I found that Tennessee summer\\nday at the top of the hill. I found that perfect moment. The perfect moment\\nwhen you push the pedal the last time before going down a huge hill on the\\nother side. The perfect moment when you hang in the balance, after all the\\nsweat, the work, and the agony, and a smile breaks across your face. That\\nmoment just before you take the glorious ride down is the “ Pinnacle Point.”\\nDave Rants...\\nSeparate checking accounts mean one of two things, either ignorance or problems.\\nAnd the ride down is glorious. The wind blows through your hair, and\\nyour feet are not on the pedals anymore but on the handlebars. The click,\\nclick, click of the baseball cards becomes a chattering with a sound like\\nthousands of crickets. You are now enjoying the ride; the coasting is the fruit\\nof your labors. Memories of strain, sweat, and repeated near failure fade as the\\nsun shines and the wind tickles your ears, whispering, “ You are the king!\\nYou did it! You climbed the hill! You didn’t quit! You paid the price to\\nwin!” The smile in your soul says, “ Accomplishment.”\\nThe ride down is glorious.\\nIf you are beginning to think I’m being a little overdramatic, so be it. It is\\nhard to describe reaching the “ Pinnacle Point” without some emotion. This\\nBaby Step takes us to the point at which your money works harder than you\\ndo, the “ Pinnacle Point.” It is the instant in time where focused gazelle\\nintensity has reached critical mass, and your money takes on a life of its own.\\nThis point is not that you are going to quit life when you get there; you\\nwill still manage and direct, but the money thing will have its feet up, and\\nyou will be coasting downhill. Wealth will find its way to you. Mistakes on\\nyour tax return will be in your favor; the IRS will discover them and send you\\nthe money back with interest. Well, that’s probably an impossible dream, but\\n\\nyou get the idea.\\nWhen your money makes more than you do, you are officially wealthy.\\nWhen you can comfortably live on your investment income, you are\\nfinancially secure. Money is a hard worker, harder than you. Money never gets\\nsick, never gets pregnant, and is never disabled. Money works twenty-four\\nhours a day, seven days a week. Money gets its job done, and it asks for only\\ndirections and a firm master.\\nWhen your money makes more than you do, you are officially wealthy.\\nYou have reached the Pinnacle Point when you can live off 8 percent of your\\nnest egg. Go ahead, multiply your nest egg by .08, and if you can live on that\\nnumber or that number is more than you make, you are coasting downhill.\\nCongratulations! Your money makes more than you do! By doing this\\ncalculation, you will discover how close you are to hitting this major financial\\nsecurity milestone. You will be able to calculate what your Pinnacle-Point\\nnest egg is, and then, using all your available income, see how many years it\\nwill take you to climb that hill. Believe me, everything is downhill after that.\\nEnjoy the ride.\\nGiving Is the Biggest Reward of the Entire Workout\\nThe most mature part of who you are will meet the kid inside as you learn to\\ninvolve yourself in the last use of money, which is to GIVE it away. Giving\\nis possibly the most fun you will ever have with money. FUN is good, but\\nyou will tire of golf and travel, and if you eat enough, lobster starts tasting\\nlike soap. INVESTING is good, but going around and around that Monopoly\\nboard eventually loses its appeal—especially after you reach the Pinnacle\\nPoint. Every mentally and spiritually healthy person I’ve met has been turned\\non by giving as long as it didn’t mean his own lights got cut off. I can\\npromise you from meeting with literally thousands of millionaires that the\\nthing the healthy ones share in common is a love of GIVING.\\n\\nOnly the strong can help the weak, and that is true of money too. A toddler\\nis not allowed to carry a newborn; only adults who have the muscular strength\\nto ensure safety should carry babies. If you want to help someone, many times\\nyou can’t do so without money. The Bible states that pure religion is actually\\nhelping the poor, not theorizing over why they are poor (see James 1:27).\\nMargaret Thatcher said, “ No one would remember the good Samaritan if he’d\\nonly had good intentions; he had money as well.” The good Samaritan had a\\ngood heart and a heavy enough purse to pay an innkeeper to help take care of\\nthe injured man. Money was involved. Money was at its best that day.\\nMoney gives power to good intentions. That’s why I’m unashamedly in favor\\nof building wealth.\\nMy father died when I was five years old, so it was just me, my two sisters, and my mom\\nfor most of my life. She did the best she could, but I never really had anyone to talk to\\nabout financial issues. So I ended up going deeply into debt buying a lot of stupid things.\\nAfter getting married and having a daughter, my wife and I decided that we needed to get\\nout of debt and start saving for the future. It took a while for us to get on a plan because we\\nwere each going our own way with our money. But eventually we decided to get rid of our\\ndebt once and for all!\\nWe\\'ve paid off $50,000, and with no new credit activity, our FICO score has taken a hit.\\n\\nBut we don\\'t care—we don\\'t worship the almighty credit score anymore! We cut up all our\\ncredit cards, put $10,000 into our emergency fund, and we\\'re now debt-free except for the\\nhouse!\\nNow that we\\'re doing well financially, we have money to give when we feel called to.\\nLast year, our daughter\\'s friend lost her father right before school started. Her mother was\\non temporary disability with little income coming in, which made her private school tuition\\na huge burden. Because I knew the pain of losing a parent, I didn\\'t want our daughter\\'s\\nfriend to deal with the loss of her father and the trauma of changing schools. So my wife\\nand I decided to step up and help by paying the girl\\'s school tuition for the year. She was\\nable to stay with her friends during that hard time in her life, and we were blessed to be\\nable to help!\\nBuying things may feel good, but giving always feels right. We\\'re thankful that God has\\ntaught us how to handle our money because now we can look for ways to bless others\\nfinancially. All the “stuff” in the world can\\'t compare to the feeling of helping others in\\nneed.\\nRon (age 44) and Teresa \\n(age 46) Brewer \\nSales; Staff Children\\'s Clinic\\nLet Go\\nSadly, I meet people who try to avoid this third use of money, mistakenly\\nthinking they will end up with more. Eric Butterworth tells of an interesting\\nsystem used to capture monkeys in the jungle. The captors use heavy glass\\nbottles with long necks. Into each bottle they deposit some sweet-smelling\\nnuts. The aroma of the nuts attracts a monkey to the bottle. When the\\nmonkey puts its hand into the bottle to get the nuts, the neck of the bottle is\\ntoo small for its fist to come back out. The monkey can’t take his hand out of\\nthe bottle without dropping the nuts, which he is unwilling to do. The\\nbottles are too heavy to carry away, so the monkey becomes trapped by\\nnothing more than greed. We may smile at these foolish monkeys, but how\\nmany times has our freedom been taken away by nothing more than our\\ngreed?\\n\\nMost of us have given something at some time or another, but I have seen\\nsome really fun things happen when good people become wealthy. When you\\nhave your Total Money Makeover, you can do some things with scale. I have\\none friend who buys seventy-five brand-new bikes for an inner-city ministry\\nevery year. He gets these bikes at Christmas, and, in conjunction with a\\nmissionary group that knows the families in the area, gives them out one at a\\ntime to kids in a subsidized housing project. The project is drug-infested and\\ncrime-riddled, but for one day a year, those young people see someone who\\nwants nothing in return.\\nAnother pastor friend of mine is involved in a project called Seeds of\\nKindness. An anonymous member of his congregation gave $50,000 to the\\ncongregation members to give away, one $100 bill at a time. The member\\nmust not use the gift, the member must receive nothing in return, and it\\nshould be given as personally as possible. These $100 bills are given human\\nto human across the city with fabulous results. People who had completely\\nlost faith in God and in the human race are shaken to the core by a simple\\n$100 gift. The givers often report having more fun than the receivers.\\nSecret Santa\\nWe all have seen these powerful examples of giving. USA Today followed a\\nguy who called himself Secret Santa at Christmas for several years. Secret\\nSanta walked the streets around Christmastime and gave away $100 bills.\\nNothing required, nothing expected. Sometimes he gave to people in need,\\nand other times he just gave. Every year he gave away around $25,000 in\\n$100 bills. He started this tradition years ago in his hometown of Kansas City\\nand moved out across America. He gave in New York after 9/11 and in the\\nVirginia/Washington, D.C., area after the sniper attacks. He just walked\\naround and handed people $100 bills. He got some fabulous reactions and\\nheard some wonderful stories.\\nIn late winter of 1971, he worked as a salesman, and when his company\\nwent broke, Santa found himself broke too. He had slept in his car for eight\\n\\ndays and hadn’t eaten for two days when he went to the Dixie Diner. He\\nordered and ate a big breakfast. He waited for the crowd to clear, then acted as\\nif he had lost his wallet. The diner’s owner, Tom Horn, who was also the\\ncook, came over near the stool where Santa had been sitting and picked up a\\n$20 bill and said, “ Son, you must have dropped this.” Santa realized later\\nthat Tom had planted that twenty to let him out of a sticky situation with his\\ndignity intact. As he drove away, Santa said, “ Thank You, Lord, for that\\nman, and I promise if I ever have money, I will do the same.”\\nIn 1999, Santa, now a very successful businessman, looked up Tom Horn,\\nnow eighty-five years old, in his home of Tupelo, Mississippi. Santa\\nrecounted the story of the hungry young man of 1971 while standing on\\nTom’s porch in a Santa hat. He asked Tom what he thought that $20 would\\nbe worth by that time and Tom laughingly said, “ Probably $10,000.” Santa\\nthen handed Tom $10,000 cash in an envelope. Of course, Tom tried to hand\\nit back, but finally Santa won out, so Tom deposited the money in the bank.\\nHe said he might need it to take care of his wife, who has Alzheimer’s.\\nHorn said of Secret Santa, “ He doesn’t want any thanks or praise for what\\nhe does. He does it out of the goodness of his heart.” After giving to dozens of\\npeople a few Christmases ago, Santa said, “ Isn’t it fun to lift people up and\\nsee the smiles on their faces?” I think I know why this Santa gave. He gave\\nbecause it is the most fun he can possibly have with money, and you will\\nnever know until you try.\\nA few years ago Secret Santa’s identity was revealed. He was Larry Stewart\\nfrom Kansas City. Larry had revealed his identity because, after giving away\\nover $1.3 million, he had been diagnosed with cancer. Larry’s wish was that\\nwe all continue his legacy of being Secret Santas. Talk about paying it\\nforward!\\nDo All Three\\nThere are only three uses for money: FUN, INVESTING, and GIVING. You\\n\\ncannot claim Total Money Makeover status until you do all three. You don’t\\nhave to buy a Harley, invest millions, or give away $25,000 cash, but you do\\nhave to do some of each. And as I said earlier, you should begin doing some\\nof each as you go through the steps. Giving something, even if it is just\\ngiving your time by serving soup to the homeless, should start from Baby\\nStep One. Fun also begins there, although it has to be inexpensive fun in the\\nbeginning; the fun gets bigger and better as we get higher in the steps.\\nInvesting, of course, begins at Baby Step Four (Invest 15 Percent of Your\\nIncome in Retirement). You are not getting the full use and enjoyment of your\\nmoney unless you do all three.\\nSomeone who never has fun with money misses the point. Someone who\\nnever invests money will never have any. Someone who never gives is a\\nmonkey with his hand in a bottle. Do some of each, and if you are married, let\\nyour spouse have some slack as soon as there is some. After you get past the\\nemergency-fund step, let each other function in the areas you like best. My\\nwife, Sharon, is a natural saver, so she always cheats toward investing. I am a\\nnatural spender, so I make sure she has fun. We both enjoy giving.\\nPlease push that pedal one more time. Switchback if you have to; failure is\\nnot an option. Push, push! I promise, and the tens of thousands who have\\nreached their Pinnacle Point in their Total Money Makeover promise, at the\\ntop of the hill is a glorious ride down. Take that ride with us!\\nI was weird before weird was cool. I started saving for my first home at age seventeen and\\npaid half down at age twenty-three. My wife, on the other hand, was slightly different.\\nWhen we got married, she had thirteen credit cards and a car payment totaling $30,000. I\\nknew this was not a good place to be as newlyweds, so we agreed to become debt-free.\\nEven though my wife was a little reluctant, we started to work on paying off the\\nconsumer debt and the $95,000 on our new house. This is when I found out about The Total\\nMoney Makeover and decided to get intense. So I started a part-time lawn-care business\\nusing the tools I already had, and my mother-in-law let me use her riding mower as long as\\nI cut her yard every Saturday. We started paying off bills left and right.\\n\\nMy wife dreamed about being a stay-at-home mom for our kids. So with the help of the\\nbooming lawn-care business and a tight budget, we killed the consumer debt in ten months,\\nand when we decided to start a family, she was able to do just that. For a long time, we put\\nalmost every free cent toward paying off our mortgage, and today we can proudly scream,\\n“We’re debt-free!”\\nArguments about money are gone. If something breaks, we just fix it or replace it. It’s\\nnot even a concern. I have all the time I want to spend with my family knowing that their\\nfuture is going to be bright because we sacrificed for it.\\nA short time after paying off the house, we started Baby Step Seven, and let me tell you .\\n. . giving money away is a great feeling and it’s easy to do when you are debt-free. Our\\nTraditional and Roth IRAs are funded, as well as college funds for our two boys. Investing\\nis key! You have to do it NOW because you can’t get that time back. Later in life, you will\\nbe so happy you did. Now we can retire the way we want to and when we want to. Today we\\nhave over $100,000 in retirement funds, $90,000 in savings, our house is now worth\\n$450,000, and we’ve paid cash for two newer cars. So my status symbol of choice is the\\npaid-off home mortgage AND the BMW in the driveway.\\nLuke (age 36) and \\nLaura (age 34) Lokietek \\nSenior Programmer Analyst; \\nHomemaker\\n\\n13 \\nLive Like \\nNo One Else\\n \\nYou started this book financially flabby, overweight with debt, out of shape in\\nsavings, and in desperate need of a personal trainer. In these pages, you have\\nreviewed how tens of thousands of ordinary people have gotten into great\\nfinancial shape. This is a book about getting out of debt and into wealth.\\nHowever, there is a problem with following The Total Money Makeover plan.\\nThe problem is simply that it’s a “ proven plan” because it works. If you\\nfollow this system, it will work. It will work so well that you are going to\\nbecome wealthy over the next twenty to forty years. The problem with\\nbecoming wealthy is that you stand a chance of becoming enamored with\\nwealth. We can easily start to worship money, especially after we have some.\\n \\nFalse Cents of Security\\n \\nAccording to Proverbs 10:15, a rich man’s wealth can become his walled city.\\nIn Bible times the wall around the city was the city’s protection from the\\nenemy. If all you get from your wealth is the wrong view of it, wealth will\\ndestroy your peace. If you get from your wealth the idea that you are some big\\ndeal because you gathered some money, you missed the essence of a Total\\nMoney Makeover. The wealthy person who is ruled by his stuff is no more\\nfree than the debt-ridden consumer we have picked on throughout the book.\\nAntoine Rivaroli said, “ There are men who gain from their wealth only the\\nfear of losing it.”\\n \\nSince you have read many pages learning a wealth-building system from\\nme, you might think that I believe stuff is the answer to happiness, emotional\\nwell-being, and spiritual maturity. You would be wrong because I know that\\nis not the case. On the contrary, I see a real spiritual danger to having great\\n\\nwealth. The danger is old-fashioned materialism. In his great book Money,\\nPossessions, and Eternity, author Randy Alcorn takes a probing look at\\nmaterialism. Randy discusses a disease running amuck in America:\\n“ Affluenza.” Affluenza is a malady that affects some of the affluent and their\\nchildren. Because some of the affluent and their children seek happiness,\\nsolace, and fulfillment in the consuming of stuff, they face a problem. By\\ntrying to get stuff to do something it wasn’t designed to do, they come up\\nempty and end up depressed and even suicidal. They discover bumper-sticker\\nwisdom: “ He who dies with the most toys is still dead.” Stuff is wonderful;\\nget some stuff, but don’t let the pursuit of wealth become your god.\\nMy wife and I are concerned that our wealth be a blessing and not a curse to\\nour children. So we are tough on our kids regarding work, saving, giving, and\\nspending issues. We expect a lot from them and have since they were small. I\\nam very proud of the character of our children. They, like their parents, aren’t\\nperfect, but they are doing well. When one of my kids was a teenager, she\\ncomplained to me, “ Do you know how tough it is being Dave Ramsey’s\\nkid? Dad, you are so hard on us, making us buy our own cars, manage our\\nown checkbooks. You cut us no slack.” I replied that we are tough on them\\nbecause one day they will inherit our wealth, and that wealth will either ruin\\ntheir lives or become a tool for great good.\\nMy kids, you, and I can have good things happen as a result of our Total\\nMoney Makeover only i f we have the spiritual character to recognize that\\nwealth is not the answer to life’s questions. We further must recognize that\\nwhile wealth is very fun, it comes with great responsibility.\\nAnother paradox is that wealth will make you more of what you are. Let\\nthat one soak in for a minute. If you are a jerk and you become wealthy, you\\nwill be king of the jerks. If you are generous and you become wealthy, you\\nwill be most generous. If you are kind, wealth will allow you to show\\nkindness in immeasurable ways. If you feel guilty, wealth will ensure that you\\nfeel guilty for the rest of your life.\\nWealth is not the answer to life’s questions.\\n\\nThe LOVE of Money, Not Money, Is the Root of All Evil\\nAs a Christian, I am amazed how certain political and religious groups have\\ndecided that wealth is evil. Many of the heroes of biblical faith, of world\\nhistory, and of our nation were very wealthy, including King David,\\nSolomon, Job, and most of our Founding Fathers. There is a negative mind-\\nset justifying money mediocrity that is maddening. Wealth is not evil, and\\npeople who possess it aren’t evil by virtue of the wealth. There are rich jerks\\nand poor jerks. Dallas Willard, in his book The Spirit of the Disciplines, says\\nto use riches is to cause them to be consumed, to trust in riches is to count\\nupon them for things they cannot provide, but to possess riches is to have the\\nright to say how they will or will not be used.\\nTo possess riches is to have the right to say how they will or will not be used.\\nIf you are a good person, it is your spiritual duty to possess riches for the\\ngood of mankind. If you are a Christian like me, it is your spiritual duty to\\npossess riches so that you can do with them things that bring glory to God.\\nThe bottom line is, if you take the stand that managing wealth is evil or\\ncarnal, then by default you leave all the wealth to the evil, carnal people. If\\nwealth is spiritually bad, then good people can’t have it, so all the bad people\\nget it. It is the duty of the good people to get wealth to keep it from the bad\\npeople, because the good people will do good with it. If we all abandon\\nmoney because some misguided souls view it as evil, then the only ones with\\nmoney will be the pornographer, the drug dealer, or the pimp. Simple\\nenough?\\nTo Give You Hope\\nI think you can tell by now that The Total Money Makeover is more than\\njust a discussion on money issues. The Total Money Makeover makes you\\nface the man or woman in the mirror. Facing that man or woman makes us\\nface emotional, relational, physical, and even spiritual aspects of our lives.\\n\\nThe wealthy people that I know who are fulfilled didn’t just have a Total\\nMONEY Makeover. They had a life makeover. Because personal finance is 80\\npercent behavior and 20 percent knowledge, you will either make your life\\nover in this process, or you will end up miserable. I’m being very spiritual\\nhere at the end, but the spiritual is a legitimate aspect of behavior. I see well-\\nrounded, mature people who become all God designed them to be when they\\nget their money closets cleaned out. God has a plan for your life, and that plan\\nisn’t to harm you; it is a plan for your future to give you hope (see Jer.\\n29:11).\\nIt is time for you to become a gazelle.\\nHope is what I want you to walk away with from this book. Hope that you\\ncan be like the people whose stories I told in this book. Hope that you can\\nturn your money troubles into money triumphs. Hope that you can retire with\\ndignity. Hope that you can change your family tree, because by building\\nwealth you leave an inheritance. Hope that you can give money in a way you\\nhave never given before. It is time for you to become a gazelle. It is time for\\nyou to leave the reading and the classroom behind and apply these principles.\\nThey are age-old principles, and they work. Tens of thousands of ordinary\\npeople just like you and me have become debt-free and even wealthy using\\nthis plan. It isn’t magic; it is common sense. The exciting thing is, anyone\\ncan do this—anyone. Are you next? I hope so.\\n\\nMeet The Winners of \\nThe Total Money Makeover Challenge\\n \\nWhen The Total Money Makeover first released, we began a contest to see\\nwho could have the greatest change in financial position in a six-month\\nperiod. Hundreds of you sent in your entries, and I had the pleasure of reading\\nall your fabulous success stories. I would have taken everyone to the\\nBahamas, but unfortunately the contest only allowed me to take ten finalists.\\nWhile at Atlantis we awarded one family— Chance and Kimberly Morrow\\nand their five children—the $50,000 grand prize. Since that time, the\\nMorrows have continued their Total Money Makeover:\\n \\nSeveral years ago we were drowning with over $56,000 in credit-card debt and a $35,000\\nincome. Our minimum payments were a whopping $1,200 each month! We met with a\\nfinancial planner who told us it would take forty years to pay off our debt. We felt hopeless\\nand continued to accumulate debt, using credit cards to pay for basics, such as groceries,\\nand any unplanned events, such as car repairs.\\n \\nChance began listening to The Dave Ramsey Show, but it took a while for him to get\\nme to reluctantly listen. I soon realized Dave had a plan that could work, and once we both\\ngot excited, there was no turning back!\\n \\n\\nThat Christmas we had planned on using Chance’s bonus check to buy a fancy tree, but\\nwhen we realized the check was just under $1,000, we decided to put up our old scrawny\\nCharlie Brown Christmas tree. Instead, that money went for Baby Step 1.\\nWe immediately stopped using all ten credit cards, and set a goal to pay off $10,000 in\\ndebt that first year. We lived on a written budget for the first time ever. We cut every\\nexpense we could, no matter how small. Chance worked crazy overtime, and we had two\\ngarage sales, selling almost everything. By the next Christmas we had surpassed our goal\\nand paid off $14,000.\\nChance decided to turn things up a notch and took a second job delivering pizzas five\\nnights a week. It was a crazy schedule, but we were attacking the debt! We accepted The\\nTotal Money Makeover Challenge as a way to keep us motivated.\\nThen we had an epiphany: If we sold our home—which we’d already outgrown—we\\ncould be debt-free with the equity we had in it. We followed Dave’s advice on getting a\\nhouse ready to sell. It took a couple of months of blood, sweat, and tears, but once the\\nhouse was ready, we had a contract within a week. Not only were we debt-free, but we had\\nour full six-month emergency fund.\\nThen came the phone call—we were finalists in The Challenge and would be going to\\nAtlantis. It was a great “attaboy” for our hard work. In Atlantis we were shocked when\\nDave announced we were the winners of The Challenge. There were so many great\\nfinalists.\\nWe gave part of the prize money to our church, took our kids on a trip to celebrate, and\\nput the rest toward the down payment on a house. But what’s bigger than the big check we\\nreceived is the change in our lives. Working together as a team strengthened our marriage\\nincredibly, and our children will never remember the time we were in bondage to debt.\\nThe best part is the peace we get from having a plan. Once upon a time if we had won\\n$50,000, we would have just spent it foolishly and then wondered where the money went.\\nFour years after beginning our Total Money Makeover, we are debt-free, including our\\nnew house. That’s just thirty-six years earlier than the financial planner estimated.\\nNot all of the blessings, however, have been financial. Shortly after returning from\\nAtlantis, Chance became a Christian. That was directly related to Dave’s ministry and this\\njourney we had taken. Chance was also reunited with a twenty-one-year-old son he had\\n\\nnot seen since infancy. It came at a time financially when Chance could just jump on a\\nplane and go see his son Ben, knowing we could afford it. And to celebrate, Chance, Ben,\\nand our ten-year-old son, Jett, took a trip back to Atlantis this summer. Like Dave says:\\nwhen you live like no one else, you really can live like no one else.\\nWe still use that old Christmas tree. It has become a symbol of what we’ve\\naccomplished, who we’ve become, and how we’ve changed our family tree.\\nDave once signed our Total Money Makeover book with Romans 12:2: “Transform!”\\nBy following Dave’s plan—which is really God’s plan—that’s exactly what we’ve done. It\\nhas been an amazing financial, relational, and spiritual transformation!\\nWe want everyone to know they can have financial peace. We share our story in hopes\\nthat others will see it really is possible and worth all the hard work.\\nKimberly and Chance \\nMorrow (both 40) \\nStay-at-Home Mom; \\nCable Technician\\n\\nAbout the Author\\n \\nDave Ramsey is the best-selling author of More Than Enough and the\\nenormously successful Financial Peace.

Money \"left over\" should be put back into a category even if you have\\nto make up a new category. You are making the spending decisions ahead of\\ntime here. Almost every category (except debt) should have some dollar\\namount in it. Example: if you do not plan ahead to replace the furniture, when\\nyou do replace it, it will cause strain or borrowing, so go ahead and plan now\\nby saving, I have actually had people tell me that they can do without\\nclothing. Oh, come ON!! Be careful in your zeal to make the numbers work\\nthat you don\\'t substitute the urgent for the important.\\nFill in the amount for each subcategory under \"Subtotal\" and then the total\\nfor each main category under \"Total.\" As you go through your first month, fill\\nin the \"Actually Spent\" column with your real expenses or the saving you did\\nfor that area. If there is a substantial difference in the plan versus the reality,\\nsomething has to give. You will either have to adjust the amount allocated to\\nthat area up and another down, or you will have to better control your\\nspending in that area.\\n\"% of Take-Home Pay\" is the percentage of take-home pay that category\\nrepresents; for example, what percentage of your total take-home pay did you\\nspend on \"Housing\"? We will then compare your percentages with those on\\nthe \"Recommended Percentages\" sheet to determine if you need to consider\\nadjusting your lifestyle.\\nAn * beside an item means you should use the \"envelope system.\"\\nThe Emergency Fund should get ALL the savings until 3 to 6 months of\\nexpenses have been saved.\\n\\nNote: Savings should be increased as you get closer to being debt-tree.\\nHint: By saving early for Christmas and other gifts, you can get great\\nbuys and give better gifts for the same money.\\n•  You have 3 \"Monthly Cash-Flow Plan\" sheets beginning on the\\nnext page.\\n•  Use these forms as your \"zero\"-based budget forms, which should\\nbe checked every few weeks.\\n•  Make enough copies to do this for a one-year period in order to\\nhelp you develop proper financial management habits.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRECOMMENDED PERCENTAGES\\nI have used a compilation of several sources and my own experience to derive\\nthe suggested percentage guidelines. However, these are only recommended\\npercentages and will change dramatically if you have a very high or very low\\nincome. For instance, if you have a very low income, your necessities\\npercentages will be high. If you have a high income, your necessities will be a\\nlower percentage of income, and hopefully savings (not debt) will be higher\\nthan recommended.\\nITEM\\n ACTUAL %  RECOMMENDED %\\nCHARITABLE GIFTS  ___________  10–15%\\nSAVING\\n ___________  5–10%\\nHOUSING\\n ___________  25–35%\\nUTILITIES\\n ___________  5–10%\\nFOOD\\n ___________  5–15%\\nTRANSPORTATION  ___________  10–15%\\nCLOTHING\\n ___________  2–7%\\nMEDICAL/HEALTH\\n ___________  5–10%\\nPERSONAL\\n ___________  5–10%\\nRECREATION\\n ___________  5–10%\\nDEBT\\n ___________  5–10%\\nINSTRUCTIONS FOR ALLOCATED-SPENDING PLAN\\nThis sheet is where all your work thus far starts giving you some peace. You\\nwill implement your \"Monthly Cash-Flow Plan\" from theory into your life by\\nusing the \"Allocated Spending Plan.\" Note: if you have an irregular income,\\nsuch as self-employment or commissions, you should use the \"Irregular\\nIncome Planning\" sheet, after reviewing your Allocated-Spending Plan.\\n\\nThere are four columns to distribute as many as four different incomes\\nwithin one month. Each column is one pay period. If you are a one-income\\nhousehold, and you get paid two times per month, then you will only use\\ntwo columns. If both of you work, and one is paid weekly and the other every\\ntwo weeks, add the two paychecks together on the weeks you both get a\\npaycheck, while just listing the one paycheck on the other two. Date the pay-\\nperiod columns, then enter the income for that period. As you allocate your\\npaycheck to an item, put the remaining total balance to the right of the slash.\\nIncome for period 3/1 in our example is $1,000, and we are allocating S100 to\\nCharitable Giving, leaving $900 to the right of the slash in that same column.\\nSome bills will come out of each pay period and some only on selected pay\\nperiods. As an example, you may take \"Car Gas\" out of every paycheck, but\\npay the electric bill from period 2. You already pay some bills or payments\\nout of designated checks, only now you pay all things from designated checks.\\nThe whole point to this sheet, which is the culmination of all your\\nmonthly planning, is to allocate or \"spend\" your whole paycheck before you\\nget paid. I don\\'t care where you allocate your money, but allocate all of it\\nbefore you get your check. Now all the tense, crisis-like symptoms have been\\nremoved, because you planned. No more management by crisis or impulse.\\nThose who tend to be impulsive should just allocate more to the \"Blow\"\\ncategory. At least you are now doing it on purpose and not by default. The\\nlast blank that you make an entry in should have a \"0\" to the right of the\\nslash, showing you have allocated your whole check.\\nAn * beside an item means you should use the \"envelope system.\" \\nEmergency Fund gets ALL the savings until 3 to 6 months of expenses have\\nbeen saved.\\nSAMPLE ALLOCATED-SPENDING PLAN\\n         PAY PERIOD:\\n 3/1\\n ________  ________  ________\\nITEM\\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n\\nINCOME\\n 1,000\\n ________  ________  ________\\nCHARITABLE GIFTS  100/900  ___/___\\n ___/___\\n ___/___\\nSAVING\\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n   Emergency Fund (1)\\n 50/850\\n ___/___\\n ___/___\\n ___/___\\n   Retirement Fund\\n ___/___  ___/___\\n ___/___\\n ___/___\\n   College Fund\\n ___/___  ___/___\\n ___/___\\n ___/___\\nHOUSING\\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n   First Mortgage\\n 725/125  ___/___\\n ___/___\\n ___/___\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIRREGULAR-INCOME PLANNING\\nMany of us have irregular incomes. If you are self-employed or work on\\ncommission or royalties, then planning your expenses is difficult, since you\\ncannot always predict your income. You should still do all the sheets except\\nthe Allocated-Spending Plan. The Monthly Cash-Flow Plan will tell you\\nwhat you have to earn monthly to survive or prosper, and those real numbers\\nare very good for goal setting.\\nWhat you must do is take the items on the Monthly Cash-Flow Plan and\\nprioritize them by importance. I repeat: by importance, not urgency. You\\nshould ask yourself, If I only have enough money to pay one thing, what\\nwould that be? Then ask, If I only have enough money to pay one more thing,\\nwhat would that be? Move this way through the list. Now be prepared to\\nstand your ground because things have a way of seeming important that are\\nonly urgent. Saving should be a high priority!\\nThe third column, \"Cumulative Amount,\" is the total of all amounts above\\nthat item. So, if you get a S2,000 check, you can see how far down your\\npriority list you can go.\\nItem\\n  \\nAmount\\n  Cumulative Amount\\n_________________   ____________   ____________\\n_________________   ____________   ____________\\n_________________   ____________   ____________\\n_________________   ____________   ____________\\n_________________   ____________   ____________\\n_________________   ____________   ____________\\n_________________   ____________   ____________\\n_________________   ____________   ____________\\n_________________   ____________   ____________\\n\\n_________________   ____________   ____________\\n_________________   ____________   ____________\\n_________________   ____________   ____________\\n_________________   ____________   ____________\\n_________________   ____________   ____________\\n_________________   ____________   ____________\\n_________________   ____________   ____________\\n_________________   ____________   ____________\\n_________________   ____________   ____________\\n_________________   ____________   ____________\\n_________________   ____________   ____________\\n_________________   ____________   ____________\\n_________________   ____________   ____________\\n_________________   ____________   ____________\\n_________________   ____________   ____________\\n_________________   ____________   ____________\\n_________________   ____________   ____________\\n_________________   ____________   ____________\\nBREAKDOWN OF SAVINGS\\nAfter your emergency fund is fully funded, you can save for certain items like\\nfurniture, car replacement, home maintenance, or clothes, and your savings\\nbalance will grow. This sheet is designed to remind you that all of that\\nmoney is committed to something, not just a Hawaiian vacation on impulse\\nbecause you are now \"rich.\" Keep up with your breakdown of savings monthly\\nfor one quarter at a time.\\n                        BALANCE\\n\\nBY\\n __________  __________  __________\\nITEM                    MONTH:  __________  __________  __________\\nEmergency Fund (1)   $1000\\n __________  __________  __________\\nEmergency Fund (2)   3-6\\nmonths\\n __________  __________  __________\\nRetirement Fund\\n __________  __________  __________\\nCollege Fund\\n __________  __________  __________\\nReal-Estate Taxes\\n __________  __________  __________\\nHomeowner\\'s Insurance\\n __________  __________  __________\\nRepairs or Mn.

Do not be\\nconcerned with interest rates or terms unless two debts have similar payoffs,\\nthen list the higher-interest-rate debt first. Paying the little debts off first gives\\nyou quick feedback, and you are more likely to stay with the plan.\\nRedo this sheet each time you pay off a debt, so you can see how close you\\nare getting to freedom. Keep the old sheets to wallpaper the bathroom in your\\nnew debt-free house. The \"New Payment\" is found by adding all the payments\\non the debts listed above that item to the payment you are working on, so\\nyou have compounding payments, which will get you out of debt very\\nquickly. \"Payments Remaining\" is the number of payments remaining on that\\ndebt when you get down the snowball to that item. \"Cumulative Payments\"\\nis the total payments needed, including the snowball, to pay off that item. In\\nother words, this is your running total for \"Payments Remaining.\"\\nCOUNTDOWN TO FREEDOM!!\\nDate:_______________\\nItem\\n Total\\nPayoff\\n Minimum\\nPayment\\n \\nNew\\nPayment  Payments\\nRemaining  Cumulative\\nPayments\\n________  ________  ________  ________  ________\\n ________\\n________  ________  ________  ________  ________\\n ________\\n________  ________  ________  ________  ________\\n ________\\n________  ________  ________  ________  ________\\n ________\\n________  ________  ________  ________  ________\\n ________\\n________  ________  ________  ________  ________\\n ________\\n________  ________  ________  ________  ________\\n ________\\n________  ________  ________  ________  ________\\n ________\\n\\n________  ________  ________  ________  ________\\n ________\\n________  ________  ________  ________  ________\\n ________\\n________  ________  ________  ________  ________\\n ________\\n________  ________  ________  ________  ________\\n ________\\nPRO RATA DEBTS\\nIf you cannot pay your creditors what they request, you should treat them all\\nfairly and the same. You should pay even the ones who are not jerks, and pay\\neveryone as much as you can. Many creditors will accept a written plan and\\ncut special deals with you as long as you are communicating, maybe even\\nover-communicating, and sending them something. We have had clients use\\nthis even when sending only $2 payments and survive for literally years.\\nPro Rata means \"their share\": the percent of total debt each creditor\\nrepresents. That will determine how much you send them. Then, you send\\nthe check with a budget and this sheet attached each month, even if the\\ncreditor says they will not accept it.\\n\\n\\nIndex\\n \\nA\\n \\nAdjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM), ♣, ♦, ♥.

As we explore this topic, we'll delve into the world of risk and return, examining the relationships between investment returns, risk, and time. Understanding these relationships is crucial for making informed investment decisions and creating a successful investment strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Concepts**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Risk**: The possibility of losing money or incurring a loss due to market fluctuations, economic downturns, or other factors.\n",
      "* **Return**: The profit or gain generated by an investment, typically measured as a percentage or as a multiple of the initial investment.\n",
      "* **Risk-Free Rate**: The rate of return on a risk-free investment, such as a U.S. Treasury bond, that reflects the market's expectations of future interest rates and inflation.\n",
      "* **Market Risk Premium**: The excess return an investor expects to earn from investing in the stock market over the risk-free rate.\n",
      "* **Time Value of Money**: The concept that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future, due to the potential for earning interest or returns on investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Real-World Examples**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Consider a 30-year-old investor who contributes $10,000 to a retirement account and expects an average annual return of 7%. Assuming the account grows at an annual rate of 7%, the investor will have approximately $56,000 in 30 years, assuming no withdrawals or fees.\n",
      "* Another example is the rise of Fidelity's Magellan Fund, which returned over 28% per year from 1977 to 1990, outperforming the S&P 500 index. However, the fund's returns were highly volatile, and investors who sold their shares during market downturns would have experienced significant losses.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Common Misconceptions**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Many investors believe that it's better to take on more risk to earn higher returns, but this approach can lead to significant losses if not managed properly.\n",
      "* Others believe that it's impossible to predict investment returns, but historical data and statistical models can help investors make more informed decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion**\n",
      "Risk and Return is a critical concept in finance that highlights the importance of considering both the potential gains and potential losses of an investment. By understanding the relationships between risk, return, and time, investors can make more informed decisions and create a successful investment strategy. Remember, risk and return are not mutually exclusive, and a well-balanced portfolio can help investors achieve their financial goals while minimizing potential losses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional insights from the provided text:\n",
      "\n",
      "* The importance of starting early: Investing $10,000 at age 30 can lead to significant returns over 30 years, but starting earlier can result in even greater wealth accumulation.\n",
      "* The benefits of diversification: Investing in a mix of assets can help reduce risk and increase potential returns over the long term.\n",
      "* The power of compounding: Investing early and consistently can lead to significant wealth accumulation over time, as the returns on the initial investment generate additional returns.\n",

In this chapter, we will explore the concept of risk and return, and how it applies to various investment opportunities. We will also examine common misconceptions and real-world examples to illustrate the importance of considering risk and return when making investment decisions.\n",

      "**Key Concepts**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Risk**: The possibility of loss or damage due to uncertainty or unpredictability.\n",
      "* **Return**: The profit or gain generated by an investment.\n",
      "* **Risk-Return Tradeoff**: The relationship between the level of risk taken and the potential return earned.\n",
      "* **Expected Return**: The average return expected from an investment over a given period.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Real-World Examples**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Consider the example of investing in stocks versus bonds. Stocks are generally considered to be riskier than bonds, as their values can fluctuate significantly. However, they also offer the potential for higher returns over the long-term. Bonds, on the other hand, are generally considered to be less risky, as they offer a fixed return. However, their returns may be lower than those of stocks.\n",
      "* Another example is the concept of diversification, which aims to reduce risk by spreading investments across different asset classes. For instance, an investor may hold a mix of stocks, bonds, and real estate to reduce the overall risk of their portfolio.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Common Misconceptions**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Many investors believe that taking on more risk will always result in higher returns. However, this is not always the case. In fact, taking on too much risk can lead to significant losses.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Conclusion**\n",
      "\n",
      "Understanding the relationship between risk and return is essential for investors seeking to achieve their financial goals. By considering the potential risks and returns of different investment opportunities, investors can make informed decisions that align with their risk tolerance and investment objectives. Remember, taking on too much risk can lead to significant losses, while taking on too little risk may result in lower returns. A balanced approach that considers both risk and return is often the most effective way to achieve long-term investment success.\n",

      "## 📖 Chapter: CHAPTER 4: Sources of Value Creation\n",
      "\n",
      "### 🔹 **Introduction**\n",
      "Risk and return are two fundamental concepts in finance that are closely intertwined. Understanding the relationship between risk and return is crucial for investors, as it helps them make informed decisions about their investments. In this chapter, we will explore the key concepts, real-world examples, and common misconceptions related to risk and return.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 🔹 **Key Concepts**\n",
      "1. **Risk**: Risk refers to the uncertainty or volatility of an investment's returns. It can be measured in terms of standard deviation, beta, or expected shortfall.\n",
      "2. **Return**: Return refers to the profit or gain generated by an investment. It can be measured in terms of expected return, actual return, or return on investment (ROI).\n",
      "3. **Risk-Return Tradeoff**: The risk-return tradeoff refers to the idea that investments with higher returns typically come with higher levels of risk, and vice versa.\n",
      "4. **Efficient Frontier**: The efficient frontier is a graphical representation of the optimal risk-return tradeoff, where investors can achieve the highest expected return for a given level of risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 🔹 **Real-World Examples**\n",
      "\n",
      "* The story of Doug and his wife, who followed the Total Money Makeover plan and paid off their debt, highlights the importance of managing risk and return in personal finance.\n",
      "* The example of Brian and Tammy McKinley, who became debt-free after following the Total Money Makeover plan, demonstrates how managing risk and return can lead to financial peace and stability.\n",
      "* The case study of the Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM) and Balloon Mortgage illustrates how risk and return can affect the value of an investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 🔹 **Common Misconceptions**\n",
      "❌ **Myth:** \"You can get rich quick\" or \"You don't need to worry about risk, just invest in something that will make you rich.\"\n",
      "❌ **Reality:** Risk and return are closely linked, and investors should carefully consider both factors before making an investment decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 🔹 **Conclusion**\n",
      "Understanding the relationship between risk and return is essential for investors and personal finance enthusiasts. By recognizing the importance of managing risk and return, individuals can make informed decisions about their investments and achieve their financial goals. Remember, risk and return are two sides of the same coin, and investors should carefully consider both factors before making an investment decision.\n",

Systematic risks include market-wide events such as recessions or economic downturns, while unsystematic risks are specific to individual companies, such as product recalls or management changes.\n",
       "* **Corporate Finance**: Companies take on various types of risks, including credit risk (default risk), market risk (interest rate or commodity price risk), and operational risk (risk of loss due to internal or external factors). A well-managed company will balance its risks and returns to achieve its financial goals.\n",
